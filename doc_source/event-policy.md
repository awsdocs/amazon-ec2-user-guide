# Automate cross\-account snapshot copies<a name="event-policy"></a>

Automating cross\-account snapshot copies enables you to copy your Amazon EBS snapshots to specific Regions in an isolated account and encrypt those snapshots with an encryption key\. This enables you to protect yourself against data loss in the event of your account being compromised\.

Automating cross\-account snapshot copies involves two accounts:
+ **Source account**—The source account is the account that creates and shares the snapshots with the target account\. In this account, you must create an EBS snapshot policy that creates snapshots at set intervals and then shares them with other AWS accounts\.
+ **Target account**—The target account is the account with destination account with which the snapshots are shared, and it is the account that creates copies of the shared snapshots\. In this account, you must create a cross\-account copy event policy that automatically copies snapshots that are shared with it by one or more specified source accounts\.

## Create cross\-account snapshot copy policies<a name="create-cac-policy"></a>

To prepare the source and target accounts for cross\-account snapshot copying, you need to perform the following steps:

**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Create the EBS snapshot policy \(*Source account*\)](#create-snapshot-policy)
+ [Step 2: Share the customer managed key \(*Source account*\)](#share-cmk)
+ [Step 3: Create cross\-account copy event policy \(*Target account*\)](#cac-policy)
+ [Step 4: Allow IAM role to use the required KMS keys \(*Target account*\)](#target_iam-role)

### Step 1: Create the EBS snapshot policy \(*Source account*\)<a name="create-snapshot-policy"></a>

In the source account, create an EBS snapshot policy that will create the snapshots and share them with the required target accounts\.

When you create the policy, ensure that you enable cross\-account sharing and that you specify the target AWS accounts with which to share the snapshots\. These are the accounts with which the snapshots are to be shared\. If you are sharing encrypted snapshots, then you must give the selected target accounts permission to use the KMS key used to encrypt the source volume\. For more information, see [Step 2: Share the customer managed key \(*Source account*\)](#share-cmk)\.

**Note**  
You can only share snapshots that are unencrypted or that are encrypted using a customer managed key\. You can't share snapshots that are encrypted with the default EBS encryption KMS key\. If you share encrypted snapshots, then you must also share the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source volume with the target accounts\. For more information, see [ Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

For more information about creating an EBS snapshot policy, see [Automate snapshot lifecycles](snapshot-ami-policy.md)\.

Use one of the following methods to create the EBS snapshot policy\.

### Step 2: Share the customer managed key \(*Source account*\)<a name="share-cmk"></a>

If you are sharing encrypted snapshots, you must grant the IAM role and the target AWS accounts \(that you selected in the previous step\) permissions to use the customer managed key that was used to encrypt the source volume\.

**Note**  
Perform this step only if you are sharing encrypted snapshots\. If you are sharing unencrypted snapshots, skip this step\.

------
#### [ Console ]

****

1. Open the AWS KMS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms)\.

1. To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper\-right corner of the page\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Customer managed key** and then select the KMS key that you need to share with the target accounts\.

   Make note of the KMS key ARN, you'll need this later\.

1. On the **Key policy** tab, scroll down to the **Key users** section\. Choose **Add**, enter the name of the IAM role that you selected in the previous step, and then choose **Add**\.

1. On the **Key policy** tab, scroll down to the **Other AWS accounts** section\. Choose **Add other AWS accounts**, and then add all of the target AWS accounts that you chose to share the snapshots with in the previous step\.

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

------
#### [ Command line ]

Use the [ get\-key\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/get-key-policy.html) command to retrieve the key policy that is currently attached to the KMS key\.

For example, the following command retrieves the key policy for a KMS key with an ID of `9d5e2b3d-e410-4a27-a958-19e220d83a1e` and writes it to a file named `snapshotKey.json`\.

```
$ aws kms get-key-policy \
--policy-name default --key-id 9d5e2b3d-e410-4a27-a958-19e220d83a1e \
--query Policy --output text > snapshotKey.json
```

Open the key policy using your preferred text editor\. Add the ARN of the IAM role that you specified when you created the snapshot policy and the ARNs of the target accounts with which to share the KMS key\.

For example, in the following policy, we added the ARN of the default IAM role, and the ARN of the root account for target account `222222222222.`

```
{
    "Sid" : "Allow use of the key",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : {
        "AWS" : [
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/service-role/AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole",
            "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:root"
        ]
    },
    "Action" : [ 
        "kms:Encrypt", 
        "kms:Decrypt", 
        "kms:ReEncrypt*", 
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*", 
        "kms:DescribeKey" 
    ],
    "Resource" : "*"
}, 
{
    "Sid" : "Allow attachment of persistent resources",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : {
        "AWS" : [
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/service-role/AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole",
            "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:root"
        ]
    },
    "Action" : [ 
        "kms:CreateGrant", 
        "kms:ListGrants", 
        "kms:RevokeGrant"
    ],
    "Resource" : "*",
    "Condition" : {
        "Bool" : {
          "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource" : "true"
        }
    }
}
```

Save and close the file\. Then use the [ put\-key\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/put-key-policy.html) command to attach the updated key policy to the KMS key\. 



```
$ aws kms put-key-policy \
--policy-name default --key-id 9d5e2b3d-e410-4a27-a958-19e220d83a1e 
--policy file://snapshotKey.json
```

------

### Step 3: Create cross\-account copy event policy \(*Target account*\)<a name="cac-policy"></a>

In the target account, you must create a cross\-account copy event policy that will automatically copy snapshots that are shared by the required source accounts\.

This policy runs in the target account only when one of the specified source accounts shares snapshot with the account\.

Use one of the following methods to create the cross\-account copy event policy\.

------
#### [ New console ]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Elastic Block Store**, **Lifecycle Manager**, and then choose **Create lifecycle policy**\.

1. On the **Select policy type** screen, choose **Cross\-account copy event policy**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. For **Policy description**, enter a brief description for the policy\.

1. For **Policy tags**, add the tags to apply to the lifecycle policy\. You can use these tags to identify and categorize your policies\.

1. In the **Event settings** section, define the snapshot sharing event that will cause the policy to run\. Do the following:

   1. For **Sharing accounts**, specify the source AWS accounts from which you want to copy the shared snapshots\. Choose **Add account**, enter the 12\-digit AWS account ID, and then choose **Add**\.

   1. For **Filter by description**, enter the required snapshot description using a regular expression\. Only snapshots that are shared by the specified source accounts and that have descriptions that match the specified filter are copied by the policy\. For more information, see [Specify snapshot description filters](#snapshot-descr-filters)\.

1. For **IAM role**, choose the IAM role that has permissions to perform snapshot copy actions\. To use the default role provided by Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, choose **Default role**\. Alternatively, to use a custom IAM role that you previously created, choose **Choose another role** and then select the role to use\.

   If you are copying encrypted snapshots, you must grant the selected IAM role permissions to use the encryption KMS key used to encrypt the source volume\. Similarly, if you are encrypting the snapshot in the destination Region using a different KMS key, you must grant the IAM role permission to use the destination KMS key\. For more information, see [Step 4: Allow IAM role to use the required KMS keys \(*Target account*\)](#target_iam-role)\.

1. In the **Copy action** section, define the snapshot copy actions that the policy should perform when it is activated\. The policy can copy snapshots to up to three Regions\. You must specify a separate copy rule for each destination Region\. For each rule that you add, do the following:

   1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the copy action\.

   1. For **Target Region**, select the Region to which to copy the snapshots\.

   1. For **Expire**, specify how long to retain the snapshot copies in the target Region after creation\.

   1. To encrypt the snapshot copy, for **Encryption**, select **Enable encryption**\. If the source snapshot is encrypted, or if encryption by default is enabled for your account, the snapshot copy is always encrypted, even if you do not enable encryption here\. If the source snapshot is unencrypted and encryption by default is not enabled for your account, you can choose to enable or disable encryption\. If you enable encryption, but do not specify a KMS key, the snapshots are encrypted using the default encryption KMS key in each destination Region\. If you specify a KMS key for the destination Region, you must have access to the KMS key\.

1. To add additional snapshot copy actions, choose **Add new Regions**\.

1. For **Policy status after creation**, choose **Enable policy** to start the policy runs at the next scheduled time, or **Disable policy** to prevent the policy from running\. If you do not enable the policy now, it will not start copying snapshots until you manually enable it after creation\.

1. Choose **Create policy**\.

------
#### [ Old console ]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Lifecycle Manager** and then choose **Create Lifecycle Policy**\.

1. For **Policy Type**, choose **Cross\-account copy event policy**\. For **Description**, enter a brief description for the policy\.

1. In the **Cross\-account copy event settings** section, for **Copy snapshots shared by**, enter the source AWS accounts from which you want to copy the shared snapshots\.

1. For **Snapshot description filter**, enter the required snapshot description using a regular expression\. Only snapshots that are shared by the specified sources accounts and that have descriptions that match the specified filter are copied by the policy\. For more information, see [Specify snapshot description filters](#snapshot-descr-filters)\. 

1. For **IAM role**, choose the IAM role that has permissions to perform the snapshot copy action\. AWS provides a default role, or you can create a custom IAM role\.

   If you are copying encrypted snapshots, you must grant the selected IAM role permissions to use the encryption KMS key used to encrypt the source volume\. Similarly, if you are encrypting the snapshot in the destination Region using a different KMS key, you must grant the IAM role permission to use the destination KMS key\. For more information, see [Step 4: Allow IAM role to use the required KMS keys \(*Target account*\)](#target_iam-role)\.

1. In the **Copy settings** section, you can configure the policy to copy snapshots to up to three Regions in the target account\. Do the following:

   1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the copy action\.

   1. For **Target Region**, select the Region to which to copy the snapshots\.

   1. For **Retain copy for**, specify how long to retain the snapshot copies in the target Region after creation\.

   1. For **Encryption**, select **Enable** to encrypt the snapshot copy in the target Region\. If the source snapshot is encrypted, or if encryption by default is enabled for your account, the snapshot copy is always encrypted, even if you do not enable encryption here\. If the source snapshot is unencrypted and encryption by default is not enabled for your account, you can choose to enable or disable encryption\. If you enable encryption, but do not specify a KMS key, the snapshots are encrypted using the default encryption KMS key in each destination Region\. If you specify a KMS key for the destination Region, you must have access to the KMS key\.

   1. \(Optional\) To copy the snapshot to additional Regions, choose **Add additional region**, and then complete the required fields\.

1. For **Policy status after creation**, choose **Enable** policy to start the policy runs at the next scheduled time\.

1. Choose **Create Policy**\.

------
#### [ Command line ]

Use the [create\-lifecycle\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/dlm/create-lifecycle-policy.html) command to create a policy\. To create a cross\-account copy event policy, for `PolicyType`, specify `EVENT_BASED_POLICY`\.

For example, the following command creates a cross\-account copy event policy in target account `222222222222`\. The policy copies snapshots that are shared by source account `111111111111`\. The policy copies snapshots to `sa-east-1` and `eu-west-2`\. Snapshots copied to `sa-east-1` are unencrypted and they are retained for 3 days\. Snapshots copied to `eu-west-2` are encrypted using KMS key `8af79514-350d-4c52-bac8-8985e84171c7` and they are retained for 1 month\. The policy uses the default IAM role\.

```
$ aws dlm create-lifecycle-policy \
--description "Copy policy" \
--state ENABLED --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/service-role/AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole \
--policy-details file://policyDetails.json
```

The following shows the contents of the `policyDetails.json` file\.

```
{
    "PolicyType" : "EVENT_BASED_POLICY",
    "EventSource" : {
        "Type" : "MANAGED_CWE",
        "Parameters": {
            "EventType" : "shareSnapshot",
            "SnapshotOwner": ["111111111111"]
        }
    },
    "Actions" : [{
        "Name" :"Copy Snapshot to Sao Paulo and London",
        "CrossRegionCopy" : [{
            "Target" : "sa-east-1",
             "EncryptionConfiguration" : {
                 "Encrypted" : false
             },
             "RetainRule" : {
             "Interval" : 3,
            "IntervalUnit" : "DAYS"
            }
        },
        {
            "Target" : "eu-west-2",
            "EncryptionConfiguration" : {
                 "Encrypted" : true,
                 "CmkArn" : "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-2:222222222222:key/8af79514-350d-4c52-bac8-8985e84171c7"
            },
            "RetainRule" : {
                "Interval" : 1,
                "IntervalUnit" : "MONTHS"
            }
        }]
    }]
}
```

Upon success, the command returns the ID of the newly created policy\. The following is example output\.

```
{
    "PolicyId": "policy-9876543210abcdef0"
}
```

------

### Step 4: Allow IAM role to use the required KMS keys \(*Target account*\)<a name="target_iam-role"></a>

If you are copying encrypted snapshots, you must grant the IAM role \(that you selected in the previous step\) permissions to use the customer managed key that was used to encrypt the source volume\.

**Note**  
Only perform this step if you are copying encrypted snapshots\. If you are copying unencrypted snapshots, skip this step\.

Use one of the following methods to add the required policies to the IAM role\.

------
#### [ Console ]

****

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Roles**\. Search for and select the IAM role that you selected when you created the cross\-account copy event policy in the previous step\. If you chose to use the default role, the role is named **AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole**\. 

1. Choose **Add inline policy** and then select the **JSON** tab\.

1. Replace the existing policy with the following, and specify the ARN of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source volumes and that was shared with you by the source account in Step 2\.
**Note**  
If you are copying from multiple source accounts, then you must specify the corresponding KMS key ARN from each source account\.

   In the following example, the policy grants the IAM role permission to use KMS key `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`, which was shared by source account `111111111111`, and KMS key `4567dcba-23ab-34cd-56ef-0987654321yz`, which exists in target account `222222222222`\.

#### [ Command line ]

Using your preferred text editor, create a new JSON file named `policyDetails.json`\. Add the following policy and specify the ARN of the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source volumes and that was shared with you by the source account in Step 2\.

**Note**  
If you are copying from multiple source accounts, then you must specify the corresponding KMS key ARN from each source account\.

In the following example, the policy grants the IAM role permission to use KMS key `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`, which was shared by source account `111111111111`, and KMS key `4567dcba-23ab-34cd-56ef-0987654321yz`, which exists in target account `222222222222`\.

Save and close the file\. Then use the [ put\-role\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/put-role-policy.html) command to add the policy to the IAM role\.

For example

```
$ aws iam put-role-policy \
--role-name AWSDataLifecycleManagerDefaultRole \
--policy-name CopyPolicy \
--policy-document file://AdminPolicy.json
```

## Specify snapshot description filters<a name="snapshot-descr-filters"></a>

When you create the snapshot copy policy in the target account, you must specify a snapshot description filter\. The snapshot description filter enables you to specify an additional level of filtering that lets you control which snapshots are copied by the policy\. This means that a snapshot is only copied by the policy if it is shared by one of the specified source accounts, and it has a snapshot description that matches the specified filter\. In other words, if a snapshot is shared by one of the specified course accounts, but it does not have a description that matches the specified filter, it is not copied by the policy\.

The snapshot filter description must be specified using a regular expression\. It is a mandatory field when creating cross\-account copy event policies using the console and the command line\. The following are example regular expressions that can be used:
+ `.*`—This filter matches all snapshot descriptions\. If you use this expression the policy will copy all snapshots that are shared by one of the specified source accounts\.
+ `Created for policy: policy-0123456789abcdef0.*`—This filter matches only snapshots that are created by a policy with an ID of `policy-0123456789abcdef0`\. If you use an expression like this, only snapshots that are shared with your account by one of the specified source accounts, and that have been created by a policy with the specified ID are copied by the policy\.
+ `.*production.*`—This filter matches any snapshot that has the word `production` anywhere in its description\. If you use this expression the policy will copy all snapshots that are shared by one of the specified source accounts and that have the specified text in their description\.

## Considerations for cross\-account snapshot copy policies<a name="event-policy-considerations"></a>

The following considerations apply to cross\-account copy event policies:
+ You can only copy snapshots that are unencrypted or that are encrypted using a customer managed key\.
+ You can create a cross\-account copy event policy to copy snapshots that are shared outside of Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager\.
+ If you want to encrypt snapshots in the target account, then the IAM role selected for the cross\-account copy event policy must have permission to use the required KMS key\.
