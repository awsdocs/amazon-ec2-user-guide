# Multiple IP addresses<a name="MultipleIP"></a>

You can specify multiple private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your instances\. The number of network interfaces and private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that you can specify for an instance depends on the instance type\. For more information, see [IP addresses per network interface per instance type](using-eni.md#AvailableIpPerENI)\.

It can be useful to assign multiple IP addresses to an instance in your VPC to do the following:
+ Host multiple websites on a single server by using multiple SSL certificates on a single server and associating each certificate with a specific IP address\.
+ Operate network appliances, such as firewalls or load balancers, that have multiple IP addresses for each network interface\. 
+ Redirect internal traffic to a standby instance in case your instance fails, by reassigning the secondary IP address to the standby instance\.

## How multiple IP addresses work<a name="MultipleIPReqs"></a>

The following list explains how multiple IP addresses work with network interfaces:
+ You can assign a secondary private IPv4 address to any network interface\. The network interface does not need to be attached to the instance\.
+ You can assign multiple IPv6 addresses to a network interface that's in a subnet that has an associated IPv6 CIDR block\.
+ You must choose a secondary IPv4 address from the IPv4 CIDR block range of the subnet for the network interface\.
+ You must choose IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR block range of the subnet for the network interface\.
+ You associate security groups with network interfaces, not individual IP addresses\. Therefore, each IP address you specify in a network interface is subject to the security group of its network interface\.
+ Multiple IP addresses can be assigned and unassigned to network interfaces attached to running or stopped instances\.
+ Secondary private IPv4 addresses that are assigned to a network interface can be reassigned to another one if you explicitly allow it\.
+ An IPv6 address cannot be reassigned to another network interface; you must first unassign the IPv6 address from the existing network interface\.
+ When assigning multiple IP addresses to a network interface using the command line tools or API, the entire operation fails if one of the IP addresses can't be assigned\.
+ Primary private IPv4 addresses, secondary private IPv4 addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and IPv6 addresses remain with a secondary network interface when it is detached from an instance or attached to an instance\.
+ Although you can't detach the primary network interface from an instance, you can reassign the secondary private IPv4 address of the primary network interface to another network interface\.

The following list explains how multiple IP addresses work with Elastic IP addresses \(IPv4 only\):
+ Each private IPv4 address can be associated with a single Elastic IP address, and vice versa\.
+ When a secondary private IPv4 address is reassigned to another interface, the secondary private IPv4 address retains its association with an Elastic IP address\.
+ When a secondary private IPv4 address is unassigned from an interface, an associated Elastic IP address is automatically disassociated from the secondary private IPv4 address\.

## Work with multiple IPv4 addresses<a name="working-with-multiple-ipv4"></a>

### Assign a secondary private IPv4 address<a name="ManageMultipleIP"></a>

You can assign the secondary private IPv4 address to the network interface for an instance as you launch the instance, or after the instance is running\. This section includes the following procedures\.
+ [To assign a secondary private IPv4 address when launching an instance](#assignIP-launch)
+ [To assign a secondary IPv4 address during launch using the command line](#assignIP-launch-cmd)
+ [To assign a secondary private IPv4 address to a network interface](#assignIP-existing)
+ [To assign a secondary private IPv4 to an existing instance using the command line](#assignIP-existing-cmd)<a name="assignIP-launch"></a>

**To assign a secondary private IPv4 address when launching an instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. Choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. Select an AMI, then choose an instance type and choose **Next: Configure Instance Details**\.

1. On the **Configure Instance Details** page, for **Network**, select a VPC and for **Subnet**, select a subnet\.

1. In the **Network Interfaces** section, do the following, and then choose **Next: Add Storage**:
   + To add another network interface, choose **Add Device**\. The console enables you to specify up to two network interfaces when you launch an instance\. After you launch the instance, choose **Network Interfaces** in the navigation pane to add additional network interfaces\. The total number of network interfaces that you can attach varies by instance type\. For more information, see [IP addresses per network interface per instance type](using-eni.md#AvailableIpPerENI)\. 
**Important**  
When you add a second network interface, the system can no longer auto\-assign a public IPv4 address\. You will not be able to connect to the instance over IPv4 unless you assign an Elastic IP address to the primary network interface \(eth0\)\. You can assign the Elastic IP address after you complete the Launch wizard\. For more information, see [Work with Elastic IP addresses](elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md#working-with-eips)\.
   + For each network interface, under **Secondary IP addresses**, choose **Add IP**, and then enter a private IP address from the subnet range, or accept the default `Auto-assign` value to let Amazon select an address\.

1. On the next **Add Storage** page, you can specify volumes to attach to the instance besides the volumes specified by the AMI \(such as the root device volume\), and then choose **Next: Add Tags**\.

1. On the **Add Tags** page, specify tags for the instance, such as a user\-friendly name, and then choose **Next: Configure Security Group**\.

1. On the **Configure Security Group** page, select an existing security group or create a new one\. Choose **Review and Launch**\. 

1. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, review your settings, and then choose **Launch** to choose a key pair and launch your instance\. If you're new to Amazon EC2 and haven't created any key pairs, the wizard prompts you to create one\.

**Important**  
After you have added a secondary private IP address to a network interface, you must connect to the instance and configure the secondary private IP address on the instance itself\. For more information, see [Configure the operating system on your instance to recognize secondary private IPv4 addresses](#StepTwoConfigOS)\.<a name="assignIP-launch-cmd"></a>

**To assign a secondary IPv4 address during launch using the command line**
+ You can use one of the following commands\. For more information about these command line interfaces, see [Access Amazon EC2](concepts.md#access-ec2)\.
  + The `--secondary-private-ip-addresses` option with the [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command \(AWS CLI\)
  + Define `-NetworkInterface` and specify the `PrivateIpAddresses` parameter with the [New\-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) command \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)\.<a name="assignIP-existing"></a>

**To assign a secondary private IPv4 address to a network interface**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**, and then select the network interface attached to the instance\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Manage IP Addresses**\.

1. Under **IPv4 Addresses**, choose **Assign new IP**\.

1. Enter a specific IPv4 address that's within the subnet range for the instance, or leave the field blank to let Amazon select an IP address for you\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Allow reassignment** to allow the secondary private IP address to be reassigned if it is already assigned to another network interface\.

1. Choose **Yes, Update**\.

Alternatively, you can assign a secondary private IPv4 address to an instance\. Choose **Instances** in the navigation pane, select the instance, and then choose **Actions**, **Networking**, **Manage IP Addresses**\. You can configure the same information as you did in the steps above\. The IP address is assigned to the primary network interface \(eth0\) for the instance\. <a name="assignIP-existing-cmd"></a>

**To assign a secondary private IPv4 to an existing instance using the command line**
+ You can use one of the following commands\. For more information about these command line interfaces, see [Access Amazon EC2](concepts.md#access-ec2)\.
  + [assign\-private\-ip\-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-private-ip-addresses.html) \(AWS CLI\)
  + [Register\-EC2PrivateIpAddress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

### Configure the operating system on your instance to recognize secondary private IPv4 addresses<a name="StepTwoConfigOS"></a>

After you assign a secondary private IPv4 address to your instance, you need to configure the operating system on your instance to recognize the secondary private IP address\.
+ If you are using Amazon Linux, the ec2\-net\-utils package can take care of this step for you\. It configures additional network interfaces that you attach while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IPv4 addresses during DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules\. You can immediately refresh the list of interfaces by using the command `sudo service network restart` and then view the up\-to\-date list using `ip addr li`\. If you require manual control over your network configuration, you can remove the ec2\-net\-utils package\. For more information, see [Configure your network interface using ec2\-net\-utils](best-practices-for-configuring-network-interfaces.md#ec2-net-utils)\.
+ If you are using another Linux distribution, see the documentation for your Linux distribution\. Search for information about configuring additional network interfaces and secondary IPv4 addresses\. If the instance has two or more interfaces on the same subnet, search for information about using routing rules to work around asymmetric routing\.

For information about configuring a Windows instance, see [Configuring a secondary private IP address for your Windows instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/config-windows-multiple-ip.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.
