The [FPGA Developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) provides the tools for developing, testing, and building AFIs\. You can use the FPGA Developer AMI on any EC2 instance with at least 32 GB of system memory \(for example, C5, M4, and R4 instances\)\.

For more information, see the documentation for the [AWS FPGA Hardware Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/)\.
