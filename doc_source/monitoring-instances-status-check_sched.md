# Scheduled events for your instances<a name="monitoring-instances-status-check_sched"></a>

AWS can schedule events for your instances, such as a reboot, stop/start, or retirement\. These events do not occur frequently\. If one of your instances will be affected by a scheduled event, AWS sends an email to the email address that's associated with your AWS account prior to the scheduled event\. The email provides details about the event, including the start and end date\. Depending on the event, you might be able to take action to control the timing of the event\. AWS also sends an AWS Health event, which you can monitor and manage by using Amazon CloudWatch Events\. For more information about monitoring AWS Health events with CloudWatch, see [Monitoring AWS Health events with CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html)\. 

Scheduled events are managed by AWS; you cannot schedule events for your instances\. You can view the events scheduled by AWS, customize scheduled event notifications to include or remove tags from the email notification, perform actions when an instance is scheduled to reboot, retire, or stop\.

To update the contact information for your account so that you can be sure to be notified about scheduled events, go to the [Account Settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account) page\.

## Types of scheduled events<a name="types-of-scheduled-events"></a>

Amazon EC2 can create the following types of events for your instances, where the event occurs at a scheduled time:
+ **Instance stop**: At the scheduled time, the instance is stopped\. When you start it again, it's migrated to a new host\. Applies only to instances backed by Amazon EBS\.
+ **Instance retirement**: At the scheduled time, the instance is stopped if it is backed by Amazon EBS, or terminated if it is backed by instance store\.
+ **Instance reboot**: At the scheduled time, the instance is rebooted\.
+ **System reboot**: At the scheduled time, the host for the instance is rebooted\.
+ **System maintenance**: At the scheduled time, the instance might be temporarily affected by network maintenance or power maintenance\.

## View scheduled events<a name="viewing_scheduled_events"></a>

In addition to receiving notification of scheduled events in email, you can check for scheduled events by using one of the following methods\.

  }
]
```

------
#### [ AWS Health ]

You can use the AWS Health Dashboard to learn about events that can affect your instance\. The AWS Health Dashboard organizes issues in three groups: open issues, scheduled changes, and other notifications\. The scheduled changes group contains items that are ongoing or upcoming\.

For more information, see [Getting started with the AWS Health Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/getting-started-phd.html) in the *AWS Health User Guide*\.

------

## Customize scheduled event notifications<a name="customizing_scheduled_event_notifications"></a>

You can customize scheduled event notifications to include tags in the email notification\. This makes it easier to identify the affected resource \(instances or Dedicated Hosts\) and to prioritize actions for the upcoming event\.

When you customize event notifications to include tags, you can choose to include:
+ All of the tags that are associated with the affected resource
+ Only specific tags that are associated with the affected resource

For example, suppose that you assign `application`, `costcenter`, `project`, and `owner` tags to all of your instances\. You can choose to include all of the tags in event notifications\. Alternatively, if you'd like to see only the `owner` and `project` tags in event notifications, then you can choose to include only those tags\.

After you select the tags to include, the event notifications will include the resource ID \(instance ID or Dedicated Host ID\) and the tag key and value pairs that are associated with the affected resource\.

**Topics**
+ [Include tags in event notifications](#register-tags)
+ [Remove tags from event notifications](#deregister-tags)
+ [View the tags to be included in event notifications](#view-tags)

## Work with instances scheduled to stop or retire<a name="schedevents_actions_retire"></a>

When AWS detects irreparable failure of the underlying host for your instance, it schedules the instance to stop or terminate, depending on the type of root device for the instance\. If the root device is an EBS volume, the instance is scheduled to stop\. If the root device is an instance store volume, the instance is scheduled to terminate\. For more information, see [Instance retirement](instance-retirement.md)\.

**Important**  
Any data stored on instance store volumes is lost when an instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated\. This includes instance store volumes that are attached to an instance that has an EBS volume as the root device\. Be sure to save data from your instance store volumes that you might need later before the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated\.

**Actions for Instances Backed by Amazon EBS**  
You can wait for the instance to stop as scheduled\. Alternatively, you can stop and start the instance yourself, which migrates it to a new host\. For more information about stopping your instance, in addition to information about the changes to your instance configuration when it's stopped, see [Stop and start your instance](Stop_Start.md)\.

You can automate an immediate stop and start in response to a scheduled instance stop event\. For more information, see [Automating Actions for EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html#automating-instance-actions) in the *AWS Health User Guide*\.

If your instance is part of an Auto Scaling group with health checks enabled, then the instance is replaced when a scheduled event is created for that instance\. The Auto Scaling group does not wait for the scheduled event to complete, but replaces the instance immediately upon receiving the notification\.

**Actions for Instances Backed by Instance Store**  
We recommend that you launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI and migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before the instance is scheduled to terminate\. Then, you can terminate the original instance, or wait for it to terminate as scheduled\.

## Work with instances scheduled for reboot<a name="schedevents_actions_reboot"></a>

When AWS must perform tasks such as installing updates or maintaining the underlying host, it can schedule the instance or the underlying host for a reboot\. You can [reschedule most reboot events](#reschedule-event) so that your instance is rebooted at a specific date and time that suits you\.

If you stop your linked [EC2\-Classic instance](vpc-classiclink.md#classiclink-limitations), it is automatically unlinked from the VPC and the VPC security groups are no longer associated with the instance\. You can link your instance to the VPC again after you've restarted it\.

If your instance is part of an Auto Scaling group with health checks enabled, then the instance is replaced when a scheduled event is created for that instance\. The Auto Scaling group does not wait for the scheduled event to complete, but replaces the instance immediately upon receiving the notification\.

### View the reboot event type<a name="view-type-of-scheduled-reboot"></a>

You can view whether a reboot event is an instance reboot or a system reboot by using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To view the type of scheduled reboot event using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.

1. Choose **Resource type: instance** from the filter list\.

1. For each instance, view the value in the **Event type** column\. The value is either **system\-reboot** or **instance\-reboot**\.

------
#### [ Old console ]

**To view the type of scheduled reboot event using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.

1. Choose **Instance resources** from the filter list\.

1. For each instance, view the value in the **Event Type** column\. The value is either **system\-reboot** or **instance\-reboot**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To view the type of scheduled reboot event using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [describe\-instance\-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.html) command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0
```

For scheduled reboot events, the value for `Code` is either `system-reboot` or `instance-reboot`\. The following example output shows a `system-reboot` event\.

```
[
    "Events": [
                {
                    "InstanceEventId": "instance-event-0d59937288b749b32",
                    "Code": "system-reboot",
                    "Description": "The instance is scheduled for a reboot",
                    "NotAfter": "2019-03-14T22:00:00.000Z",
                    "NotBefore": "2019-03-14T20:00:00.000Z",
                    "NotBeforeDeadline": "2019-04-05T11:00:00.000Z"
                }
              ]
]
```

------
<a name="schedevents_actions_instancereboot"></a>
**Actions for instance reboot**  
You can wait for the instance reboot to occur within its scheduled maintenance window, [reschedule](#reschedule-event) the instance reboot to a date and time that suits you, or [reboot](ec2-instance-reboot.md) the instance yourself at a time that is convenient for you\.

After your instance is rebooted, the scheduled event is cleared and the event's description is updated\. The pending maintenance to the underlying host is completed, and you can begin using your instance again after it has fully booted\.
<a name="schedevents_actions_systemreboot"></a>
**Actions for system reboot**  
It is not possible for you to reboot the system yourself\. You can wait for the system reboot to occur during its scheduled maintenance window, or you can [reschedule](#reschedule-event) the system reboot to a date and time that suits you\. A system reboot typically completes in a matter of minutes\. After the system reboot has occurred, the instance retains its IP address and DNS name, and any data on local instance store volumes is preserved\. After the system reboot is complete, the scheduled event for the instance is cleared, and you can verify that the software on your instance is operating as expected\.

Alternatively, if it is necessary to maintain the instance at a different time and you can't reschedule the system reboot, then you can stop and start an Amazon EBS\-backed instance, which migrates it to a new host\. However, the data on the local instance store volumes is not preserved\. You can also automate an immediate instance stop and start in response to a scheduled system reboot event\. For more information, see [Automating Actions for EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html#automating-instance-actions) in the *AWS Health User Guide*\. For an instance store\-backed instance, if you can't reschedule the system reboot, then you can launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI, migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before the scheduled maintenance window, and then terminate the original instance\.

## Work with instances scheduled for maintenance<a name="schedevents_actions_maintenance"></a>

When AWS must maintain the underlying host for an instance, it schedules the instance for maintenance\. There are two types of maintenance events: network maintenance and power maintenance\.

During network maintenance, scheduled instances lose network connectivity for a brief period of time\. Normal network connectivity to your instance is restored after maintenance is complete\.

During power maintenance, scheduled instances are taken offline for a brief period, and then rebooted\. When a reboot is performed, all of your instance's configuration settings are retained\.

After your instance has rebooted \(this normally takes a few minutes\), verify that your application is working as expected\. At this point, your instance should no longer have a scheduled event associated with it, or if it does, the description of the scheduled event begins with **\[Completed\]**\. It sometimes takes up to 1 hour for the instance status description to refresh\. Completed maintenance events are displayed on the Amazon EC2 console dashboard for up to a week\.

**Actions for Instances Backed by Amazon EBS**  
You can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled\. Alternatively, you can stop and start the instance, which migrates it to a new host\. For more information about stopping your instance, in addition to information about the changes to your instance configuration when it's stopped, see [Stop and start your instance](Stop_Start.md)\.

You can automate an immediate stop and start in response to a scheduled maintenance event\. For more information, see [Automating Actions for EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html#automating-instance-actions) in the *AWS Health User Guide*\.

**Actions for instances backed by instance store**  
You can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled\. Alternatively, if you want to maintain normal operation during a scheduled maintenance window, you can launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI, migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before the scheduled maintenance window, and then terminate the original instance\.

## Reschedule a scheduled event<a name="reschedule-event"></a>

You can reschedule an event so that it occurs at a specific date and time that suits you\. Only events that have a deadline date can be rescheduled\. There are other [limitations for rescheduling an event](#limitations-for-rescheduling)\.

You can reschedule an event by using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To reschedule an event using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.

1. Choose **Resource type: instance** from the filter list\.

1. Select one or more instances, and then choose **Actions**, **Schedule event**\.

   Only events that have an event deadline date, indicated by a value for **Deadline**, can be rescheduled\. If one of the selected events does not have a deadline date, **Actions**, **Schedule event** is disabled\.

1. For **New start time**, enter a new date and time for the event\. The new date and time must occur before the **Event deadline**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

   It might take a minute or 2 for the updated event start time to be reflected in the console\.

------
#### [ Old console ]

**To reschedule an event using the console**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.

1. Choose **Instance resources** from the filter list\.

1. Select one or more instances, and then choose **Actions**, **Schedule Event**\.

   Only events that have an event deadline date, indicated by a value for **Event Deadline**, can be rescheduled\. 

1. For **Event start time**, enter a new date and time for the event\. The new date and time must occur before the **Event Deadline**\.

1. Choose **Schedule Event**\.

   It might take a minute or 2 for the updated event start time to be reflected in the console\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To reschedule an event using the AWS CLI**

1. Only events that have an event deadline date, indicated by a value for `NotBeforeDeadline`, can be rescheduled\. Use the [describe\-instance\-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.html) command to view the `NotBeforeDeadline` parameter value\.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0
   ```

   The following example output shows a `system-reboot` event that can be rescheduled because `NotBeforeDeadline` contains a value\.

   ```

                       "NotBeforeDeadline": "2019-04-05T11:00:00.000Z"
                   }
                 ]
   ]
   ```

1. To reschedule the event, use the [modify\-instance\-event\-start\-time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-event-start-time.html) command\. Specify the new event start time by using the `not-before` parameter\. The new event start time must fall before the `NotBeforeDeadline`\.

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-event-start-time --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-event-id instance-event-0d59937288b749b32 --not-before 2019-03-25T10:00:00.000
   ```

   It might take a minute or 2 before the [describe\-instance\-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.html) command returns the updated `not-before` parameter value\.

### Limitations<a name="limitations-for-rescheduling"></a>
+ Only events with an event deadline date can be rescheduled\. The event can be rescheduled up to the event deadline date\. The **Deadline** column in the console and the `NotBeforeDeadline` field in the AWS CLI indicate if the event has a deadline date\.
+ Only events that have not yet started can be rescheduled\. The **Start time** column in the console and the `NotBefore` field in the AWS CLI indicate the event start time\. Events that are scheduled to start in the next 5 minutes cannot be rescheduled\.
+ The new event start time must be at least 60 minutes from the current time\.
+ If you reschedule multiple events using the console, the event deadline date is determined by the event with the earliest event deadline date\.
