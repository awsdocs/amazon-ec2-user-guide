## Create a key pair using Amazon EC2<a name="having-ec2-create-your-key-pair"></a>

When you create a key pair using Amazon EC2, the public key is stored in Amazon EC2, and you store the private key\.

You can use Amazon EC2 to create a key pair using one of the following methods\. 

------
#### [ Console ]

**To create a key pair using Amazon EC2**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Network & Security**, choose **Key Pairs**\.

1. Choose **Create key pair**\.

1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the key pair\. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name\. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters\. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces\.

1. For **Key pair type**, choose either **RSA** or **ED25519**\. Note that **ED25519** keys are not supported for Windows instances\.

1. For **Private key file format**, choose the format in which to save the private key\. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose **pem**\. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose **ppk**\.

   If you chose **ED25519** in the previous step, the **Private key file format** options do not appear, and the private key format defaults to **pem**\.

1. To add a tag to the public key, choose **Add tag**, and enter the key and value for the tag\. Repeat for each tag\. 

1. Choose **Create key pair**\.

1. The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser\. The base file name is the name that you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format that you chose\. Save the private key file in a safe place\.
**Important**  
This is the only chance for you to save the private key file\.

1. If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it\.

   ```
   chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
   ```

   If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair\. For more information, see [Error: Unprotected private key file](TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.md#troubleshoot-unprotected-key)\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To create a key pair using Amazon EC2**

1. Use the [create\-key\-pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-key-pair.html) command as follows to generate the key pair and to save the private key to a `.pem` file\.

   For `--key-name`, specify a name for the public key\. The name can be up to 255 ASCII characters\.

   For `--key-type`, specify either `rsa` or `ed25519`\. If you do not include the `--key-type` parameter, an `rsa` key is created by default\. Note that ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances\.

   `--query "KeyMaterial"` prints the private key material to the output\.

   `--output text > my-key-pair.pem` saves the private key material in a file with the `.pem` extension\. The private key can have a name that's different from the public key name, but for ease of use, use the same name\.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-key-pair \
       --key-name my-key-pair \
       --key-type rsa \
       --query "KeyMaterial" \
       --output text > my-key-pair.pem
   ```

1. If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it\.

   ```
   chmod 400 my-key-pair.pem
   ```

   If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair\. For more information, see [Error: Unprotected private key file](TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.md#troubleshoot-unprotected-key)\.

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To create a key pair using Amazon EC2**  
Use the [New\-EC2KeyPair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2KeyPair.html) AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell command as follows to generate the key and save it to a `.pem` file\.

For `-KeyName`, specify a name for the public key\. The name can be up to 255 ASCII characters\.

For `-KeyType`, specify either `rsa` or `ed25519`\. If you do not include the `-KeyType` parameter, an `rsa` key is created by default\. Note that ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances\.

`KeyMaterial` prints the private key material to the output\.

`Out-File -Encoding ascii -FilePath C:\path\my-key-pair.pem` saves the private key material in a file with the `.pem` extension\. The private key can have a name that's different from the public key name, but for ease of use, use the same name\.

```
PS C:\> (New-EC2KeyPair -KeyName "my-key-pair" -KeyType "rsa").KeyMaterial | Out-File -Encoding ascii -FilePath C:\path\my-key-pair.pem
```

## Create a key pair using a third\-party tool and import the public key to Amazon EC2<a name="how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws"></a>

Instead of using Amazon EC2 to create a key pair, you can create an RSA or ED25519 key pair by using a third\-party tool, and then import the public key to Amazon EC2\.

**Requirements for key pairs**
+ Supported types: RSA and ED25519\. Amazon EC2 does not accept DSA keys\.
  + Note that ED25519 keys are not supported for Windows instances\.
+ Supported formats:
  + OpenSSH public key format \(the format in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\)\. If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the SSH2 format is also supported\.
  + SSH private key file format must be PEM
  + \(RSA only\) Base64 encoded DER format
  + \(RSA only\) SSH public key file format as specified in [RFC 4716](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4716.txt)
+ Supported lengths: 1024, 2048, and 4096\. If you connect using SSH while using the EC2 Instance Connect API, the supported lengths are 2048 and 4096\.

**To create a key pair using a third\-party tool**

1. Generate a key pair with a third\-party tool of your choice\. For example, you can use ssh\-keygen \(a tool provided with the standard OpenSSH installation\)\. Alternatively, Java, Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages provide standard libraries that you can use to create an RSA or ED25519 key pair\.
**Important**  
The private key must be in the PEM format\. For example, use `ssh-keygen -m PEM` to generate the OpenSSH key in the PEM format\.

1. Save the public key to a local file\. For example, `~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pub`\. The file name extension for this file is not important\.

1. Save the private key to a local file that has the `.pem` extension\. For example, `~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem`\.
**Important**  
Save the private key file in a safe place\. You'll need to provide the name of your public key when you launch an instance, and the corresponding private key each time you connect to the instance\.

After you have created the key pair, use one of the following methods to import your public key to Amazon EC2\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To import the public key to Amazon EC2**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Key Pairs**\.

1. Choose **Import key pair**\.

1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the public key\. The name can include up to 255 ASCII characters\. It can’t include leading or trailing spaces\.
**Note**  
When you connect to your instance from the EC2 console, the console suggests this name for the name of your private key file\.

1. Either choose **Browse** to navigate to and select your public key, or paste the contents of your public key into the **Public key contents** field\.

1. Choose **Import key pair**\.

1. Verify that the public key that you imported appears in the list of key pairs\.
