# Delete an Amazon EBS volume<a name="ebs-deleting-volume"></a>

You can delete an Amazon EBS volume that you no longer need\. After deletion, its data is gone and the volume can't be attached to any instance\. So before deletion, you can store a snapshot of the volume, which you can use to re\-create the volume later\. 

**Note**  
You can't delete a volume if it's attached to an instance\. To delete a volume, you must first detach it\. For more information, see [Detach an Amazon EBS volume from a Linux instance](ebs-detaching-volume.md)\.  
You can check if a volume is attached to an instance\. In the console, on the **Volumes** page, you can view the state of your volumes\.  
If a volume is attached to an instance, it’s in the `in-use` state\.
If a volume is detached from an instance, it’s in the `available` state\. You can delete this volume\.
