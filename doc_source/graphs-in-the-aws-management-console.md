# Graph metrics for your instances<a name="graphs-in-the-aws-management-console"></a>

After you launch an instance, you can open the Amazon EC2 console and view the monitoring graphs for the instance on the **Monitoring** tab\. Each graph is based on one of the available Amazon EC2 metrics\.

The following graphs are available:
+ Average CPU Utilization \(Percent\)
+ Average Disk Reads \(Bytes\)
+ Average Disk Writes \(Bytes\)
+ Maximum Network In \(Bytes\)
+ Maximum Network Out \(Bytes\)
+ Summary Disk Read Operations \(Count\)
+ Summary Disk Write Operations \(Count\)
+ Summary Status \(Any\)
+ Summary Status Instance \(Count\)
+ Summary Status System \(Count\)

For more information about the metrics and the data they provide to the graphs, see [List the available CloudWatch metrics for your instances](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md)\.

**Graph metrics using the CloudWatch console**  
You can also use the CloudWatch console to graph metric data generated by Amazon EC2 and other AWS services\. For more information, see [Graphing metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph_metrics.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
