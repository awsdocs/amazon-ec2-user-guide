# Recover your instance<a name="ec2-instance-recover"></a>

To automatically recover an instance when a system status check failure occurs, you can use the default configuration of the instance or create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm\. If an instance becomes unreachable because of an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair, the instance is automatically recovered\.

A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata\. If the impaired instance has a public IPv4 address, the instance retains the public IPv4 address after recovery\. If the impaired instance is in a placement group, the recovered instance runs in the placement group\. During instance recovery, the instance is migrated as part of an instance reboot, and any data that is in\-memory is lost\.

Examples of problems that require instance recovery:
+ Loss of network connectivity
+ Loss of system power
+ Software issues on the physical host
+ Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability

## Simplified automatic recovery based on instance configuration<a name="instance-configuration-recovery"></a>

Instances that support simplified automatic recovery are configured by default to recover a failed instance\. The default configuration applies to new instances that you launch and existing instances that you previously launched\. Simplified automatic recovery is initiated in response to system status check failures\. Simplified automatic recovery doesn't take place during Service Health Dashboard events, or any other events that impact the underlying hardware\. For more information, see [Troubleshoot instance recovery failures](#TroubleshootingInstanceRecovery)\.

When a simplified automatic recovery event succeeds, you are notified by an AWS Health Dashboard event\. When a simplified automatic recovery event fails, you are notified by an AWS Health Dashboard event and by email\. You can also use Amazon EventBridge rules to monitor for simplified automatic recovery events using the following event codes:
+ `AWS_EC2_SIMPLIFIED_AUTO_RECOVERY_SUCCESS` — successful events
+ `AWS_EC2_SIMPLIFIED_AUTO_RECOVERY_FAILURE` — failed events

For more information, see [ Amazon EventBridge rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html)\.

### Requirements<a name="requirements-for-recovery"></a>

Simplified automatic recovery is supported by an instance if the instance has the following characteristics:
+ It uses `default` or `dedicated` instance tenancy\.
+ It does not use an Elastic Fabric Adapter\.
+ It uses one of the following instance types:
  + **General purpose:** A1 \| M3 \| M4 \| M5 \| M5a \| M5n \| M5zn \| M6a \| M6g \| M6i \| M6in \| M7g \| T1 \| T2 \| T3 \| T3a \| T4g
  + **Compute optimized:** C3 \| C4 \| C5 \| C5a \| C5n \| C6a \| C6g \| C6gn \| C6i \| C6in \| C7g \| Hpc6a
  + **Memory optimized:** R3 \| R4 \| R5 \| R5a \| R5b \| R5n \| R6a \| R6g \| R6i \| R6in \| R7g \| u\-3tb1 \| u\-6tb1 \| u\-9tb1 \| u\-12tb1 \| u\-18tb1 \| u\-24tb1 \| X1 \| X1e \| X2iezn
  + **Accelerated computing:** G3 \| G3s \| G5g \| Inf1 \| P2 \| P3 \| VT1
+ It does not have instance store volumes\.

### Limitations<a name="limitations-simplified-recovery"></a>
+ Instances with instance store volumes and metal instance types are not supported by simplified automatic recovery\.
+ If your instance is part of an Auto Scaling group with health checks enabled, then the instance is replaced when it becomes impaired\. Automatic recovery is not initiated for instances inside an Auto Scaling group\.
+ Simplified automatic recovery applies to unplanned events only\. It does not apply to scheduled events\.
+ Terminated or stopped instances cannot be recovered\.

### Verify the recovery behavior<a name="verify-recovery-behavior"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to view the instance types that support simplified automatic recovery\.

------

## Amazon CloudWatch action based recovery<a name="cloudwatch-recovery"></a>

Use Amazon CloudWatch action based recovery if you want to customize when to recover your instance\.

When the `StatusCheckFailed_System` alarm is triggered, and the recovery action is initiated, you're notified by the Amazon SNS topic that you selected when you created the alarm and associated the recovery action\. When the recovery action is complete, information is published to the Amazon SNS topic you configured for the alarm\. Anyone who is subscribed to this Amazon SNS topic receives an email notification that includes the status of the recovery attempt and any further instructions\. As a last step in the recovery action, the recovered instance reboots\.

All of the instance types [supported by simplified automatic recovery](#requirements-for-recovery) are also supported by CloudWatch action based recovery\. Additionaly, Amazon CloudWatch action based recovery supports the following instance types with instance store volumes\.
+ **General purpose:** M3
+ **Compute optimized:** C3
+ **Memory optimized:** R3 \| X1 \| X1e \| X2idn \| X2iedn

**Important**  
If the instance has instance store volumes attached, the data is lost during recovery\.

Amazon CloudWatch action based recovery does not support recovery for instances with Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts tenancy and metal instances\.

You can use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to recover an instance even if simplified automatic recovery is not disabled\. For information about creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to recover an instance, see [Add recover actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms](UsingAlarmActions.md#AddingRecoverActions)\.

## Troubleshoot instance recovery failures<a name="TroubleshootingInstanceRecovery"></a>

The following issues can cause the recovery of your instance to fail:
+ Service Health Dashboard events or events that impact the underlying rack\. During such events, simplified automatic recovery does not recover instances\. You will not receive recovery failure notifications for such events\. Any ongoing Service Health Dashboard events may also prevent Amazon CloudWatch action based recovery from successfully recovering an instance\. See [http://status\.aws\.amazon\.com/](http://status.aws.amazon.com/) for the latest service availability information\.
+ Temporary, insufficient capacity of replacement hardware\.
+ The instance has an attached instance store storage, which is an unsupported configuration for automatic instance recovery\.
+ The instance has reached the maximum daily allowance of three recovery attempts\.

The automatic recovery process attempts to recover your instance for up to three separate failures per day\. If the instance system status check failure persists, we recommend that you manually stop and start the instance\. For more information, see [Stop and start your instance](Stop_Start.md)\.

Your instance might subsequently be retired if automatic recovery fails and a hardware degradation is determined to be the root cause for the original system status check failure\.
