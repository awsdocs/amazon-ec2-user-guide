# File storage<a name="file-storage"></a>

Cloud file storage is a method for storing data in the cloud that provides servers and applications access to data through shared file systems\. This compatibility makes cloud file storage ideal for workloads that rely on shared file systems and provides simple integration without code changes\.

There are many file storage solutions that exist, ranging from a single node file server on a compute instance using block storage as the underpinnings with no scalability or few redundancies to protect the data, to a do\-it\-yourself clustered solution, to a fully\-managed solution\. The following content introduces some of the storage services provided by AWS for use with Linux\.
