# Capacity Reservations in Local Zones<a name="capacity-reservations-localzones"></a>

A Local Zone is an extension of an AWS Region that is geographically close to your users\. Resources created in a Local Zone can serve local users with very low\-latency communications\. For more information, see [AWS Local Zones](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/)\. 

You can extend a VPC from its parent AWS Region into a Local Zone by creating a new subnet in that Local Zone\. When you create a subnet in a Local Zone, your VPC is extended to that Local Zone\. The subnet in the Local Zone operates the same as the other subnets in your VPC\.

By using Local Zones, you can place Capacity Reservations in multiple locations that are closer to your users\. You create and use Capacity Reservations in Local Zones in the same way that you create and use Capacity Reservations in regular Availability Zones\. The same features and instance matching behavior apply\. For more information about the pricing models that are supported in Local Zones, see [AWS Local Zones FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/faqs/)\.

**Considerations**  
You can't use Capacity Reservation groups in a Local Zone\.

**To use a Capacity Reservation in a Local Zone**

1. Enable the Local Zone for use in your AWS account\. For more information, see [Opt in to Local Zones](using-regions-availability-zones.md#opt-in-local-zone)\. 

1. Create a Capacity Reservation in the Local Zone\. For **Availability Zone**, choose the Local Zone\. The Local Zone is represented by an AWS Region code followed by an identifier that indicates the location, for example `us-west-2-lax-1a`\. For more information, see [Create a Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-using.md#capacity-reservations-create)\. 

1. Create a subnet in the Local Zone\. For **Availability Zone**, choose the Local Zone\. For more information, see [ Creating a subnet in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html#AddaSubnet) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. 

1. Launch an instance\. For **Subnet**, choose the subnet in the Local Zone \(for example `subnet-123abc | us-west-2-lax-1a`\), and for **Capacity Reservation**, choose the specification \(either `open` or target it by ID\) that's required for the Capacity Reservation that you created in the Local Zone\. For more information, see [Launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-using.md#capacity-reservations-launch)\.
