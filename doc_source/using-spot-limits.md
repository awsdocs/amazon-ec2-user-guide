# Spot Instance limits<a name="using-spot-limits"></a>

There is a limit on the number of running and requested Spot Instances per AWS account per Region\. Spot Instance limits are managed in terms of the *number of virtual central processing units \(vCPUs\)* that your running Spot Instances are either using or will use pending the fulfillment of open Spot Instance requests\. If you terminate your Spot Instances but do not cancel the Spot Instance requests, the requests count against your Spot Instance vCPU limit until Amazon EC2 detects the Spot Instance terminations and closes the requests\.

There are seven Spot Instance limits:
+ All Standard \(A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z\) Spot Instance Requests
+ All DL Spot Instance Requests
+ All F Spot Instance Requests
+ All G and VT Spot Instance Requests
+ All Inf Spot Instance Requests
+ All P Spot Instance Requests
+ All X Spot Instance Requests

Each limit specifies the vCPU limit for one or more instance families\. For information about the different instance families, generations, and sizes, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)\.

With vCPU limits, you can use your limit in terms of the number of vCPUs that are required to launch any combination of instance types that meet your changing application needs\. For example, say your All Standard Spot Instance Requests limit is 256 vCPUs, you could request 32 `m5.2xlarge` Spot Instances \(32 x 8 vCPUs\) or 16 `c5.4xlarge` Spot Instances \(16 x 16 vCPUs\), or a combination of any Standard Spot Instance types and sizes that total 256 vCPUs\.

## Monitor Spot Instance limits and usage<a name="monitoring-spot-limits"></a>

You can view and manage your Spot Instance limits using the following:
+ The [Limits page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/#Limits) in the Amazon EC2 console
+ The Amazon EC2 [Services quotas page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/#!/services/ec2/quotas) in the Service Quotas console
+ The [get\-service\-quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/service-quotas/get-service-quota.html) AWS CLI

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 service quotas](ec2-resource-limits.md) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* and [Viewing service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/gs-request-quota.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. 

With Amazon CloudWatch metrics integration, you can monitor EC2 usage against limits\. You can also configure alarms to warn about approaching limits\. For more information, see [Service Quotas and Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/configure-cloudwatch.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.

## Request a Spot Instance limit increase<a name="spot-vcpu-limits-request-increase"></a>

Even though Amazon EC2 automatically increases your Spot Instance limits based on your usage, you can request a limit increase if necessary\. For example, if you intend to launch more Spot Instances than your current limit allows, you can request a limit increase\. You can also request a limit increase if you submit a Spot Instance request and you receive the error `Max spot instance count exceeded`\.

**To request a Spot Instance limit increase**

1. Open the **Create case**, **Service limit increase** form in the Support Center console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/support/home\#/case/create](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-ec2-spot-instances)\.

1. For **Limit type**, choose **EC2 Spot Instances**\.

1. For **Region**, select the required Region\.

1. For **Primary instance type**, select the Spot Instance limit for which you want to request a limit increase\.

1. For **New limit value**, enter the total number of vCPUs that you want to run concurrently\. To determine the total number of vCPUs that you need, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) to find the number of vCPUs of each instance type\. 

1. \(Conditional\) You must create a separate limit request for each Spot Instance limit\. To request an increase for another Spot Instance limit, choose **Add another request** and repeat steps 4 and 5 in this procedure\.

1. For **Use case description**, enter your use case, and then choose **Submit**\.
