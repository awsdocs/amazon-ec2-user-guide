# Linux accelerated computing instances<a name="accelerated-computing-instances"></a>

Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or co\-processors, to perform some functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs\. These instances enable more parallelism for higher throughput on compute\-intensive workloads\.

If you require high processing capability, you'll benefit from using accelerated computing instances, which provide access to hardware\-based compute accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units \(GPUs\), Field Programmable Gate Arrays \(FPGAs\), or AWS Inferentia\.

## Instance performance<a name="gpu-instance-performance"></a>

There are several GPU setting optimizations that you can perform to achieve the best performance on your instances\. For more information, see [Optimize GPU settings](optimize_gpu.md)\.

EBS\-optimized instances enable you to get consistently high performance for your EBS volumes by eliminating contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other network traffic from your instance\. Some accelerated computing instances are EBS\-optimized by default at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“optimized instances](ebs-optimized.md)\.

Some accelerated computing instance types provide the ability to control processor C\-states and P\-states on Linux\. C\-states control the sleep levels that a core can enter when it is inactive, while P\-states control the desired performance \(in CPU frequency\) from a core\. For more information, see [Processor state control for your EC2 instance](processor_state_control.md)\.

## Network performance<a name="gpu-network-performance"></a>

You can enable enhanced networking on supported instance types to provide lower latencies, lower network jitter, and higher packet\-per\-second \(PPS\) performance\. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data\. For more information, see [Enhanced networking on Linux](enhanced-networking.md)\.

The following is a summary of network performance for accelerated computing instances that support enhanced networking\.

## Amazon EBS I/O performance<a name="accelerated-ebs-perf"></a>

Amazon EBS optimized instances use an optimized configuration stack and provide additional, dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS I/O\. This optimization provides the best performance for your Amazon EBS volumes by minimizing contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other traffic from your instance\.

For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“optimized instances](ebs-optimized.md)\.

## SSD\-based instance store volume I/O performance<a name="accelerated-computing-ssd-perf"></a>

If you use a Linux AMI with kernel version 4\.4 or later and use all the SSD\-based instance store volumes available to your instance, you can get up to the IOPS \(4,096 byte block size\) performance listed in the following table \(at queue depth saturation\)\. Otherwise, you get lower IOPS performance\.


| Instance Size | 100% Random Read IOPS | Write IOPS | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| g4ad\.xlarge | 10,417 | 8,333 | 
| g4ad\.2xlarge | 20,833 | 16,667 | 
| g4ad\.4xlarge | 41,667 | 33,333 | 
| g4ad\.8xlarge | 83,333 | 66,667 | 
| g4ad\.16xlarge | 166,667 | 133,333 | 
| g5\.xlarge | 40,625 | 20,313 | 
| g5\.2xlarge | 40,625 | 20,313 | 
| g5\.4xlarge | 125,000 | 62,500 | 
| g5\.8xlarge | 250,000 | 125,000 | 
| g5\.12xlarge | 312,500 | 156,250 | 
| g5\.16xlarge | 250,000 | 125,000 | 
| g5\.24xlarge | 312,500 | 156,250 | 
| g5\.48xlarge | 625,000 | 312,500 | 

As you fill the SSD\-based instance store volumes for your instance, the number of write IOPS that you can achieve decreases\. This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten\. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations\. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096\-byte boundary\. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location\. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance\.

SSD controllers can use several strategies to reduce the impact of write amplification\. One such strategy is to reserve space in the SSD instance storage so that the controller can more efficiently manage the space available for write operations\. This is called *over\-provisioning*\. The SSD\-based instance store volumes provided to an instance don't have any space reserved for over\-provisioning\. To reduce write amplification, we recommend that you leave 10% of the volume unpartitioned so that the SSD controller can use it for over\-provisioning\. This decreases the storage that you can use, but increases performance even if the disk is close to full capacity\.

For instance store volumes that support TRIM, you can use the TRIM command to notify the SSD controller whenever you no longer need data that you've written\. This provides the controller with more free space, which can reduce write amplification and increase performance\. For more information, see [Instance store volume TRIM support](ssd-instance-store.md#InstanceStoreTrimSupport)\.

## Release notes<a name="gpu-instance-release-notes"></a>
+ You must launch the instance using an HVM AMI\.
+ Instances built on the [Nitro System](instance-types.md#ec2-nitro-instances) have the following requirements:
  + [NVMe drivers](nvme-ebs-volumes.md) must be installed
  + [Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) drivers](enhanced-networking-ena.md) must be installed

  The following Linux AMIs meet these requirements:
  + Amazon Linux 2
  + Amazon Linux AMI 2018\.03
  + Ubuntu 14\.04 or later with `linux-aws` kernel
**Note**  
AWS Graviton\-based instance types require Ubuntu 18\.04 or later with `linux-aws` kernel
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\.4 or later
  + SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 or later
  + CentOS 7\.4\.1708 or later
  + FreeBSD 11\.1 or later
  + Debian GNU/Linux 9 or later
+ GPU\-based instances can't access the GPU unless the NVIDIA drivers are installed\. For more information, see [Install NVIDIA drivers on Linux instances](install-nvidia-driver.md)\.
+ Launching a bare metal instance boots the underlying server, which includes verifying all hardware and firmware components\. This means that it can take 20 minutes from the time the instance enters the running state until it becomes available over the network\.
+ To attach or detach EBS volumes or secondary network interfaces from a bare metal instance requires PCIe native hotplug support\. Amazon Linux 2 and the latest versions of the Amazon Linux AMI support PCIe native hotplug, but earlier versions do not\. You must enable the following Linux kernel configuration options:

  ```
  CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE=y
  CONFIG_PCIEASPM=y
  ```
+ Bare metal instances use a PCI\-based serial device rather than an I/O port\-based serial device\. The upstream Linux kernel and the latest Amazon Linux AMIs support this device\. Bare metal instances also provide an ACPI SPCR table to enable the system to automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\. The latest Windows AMIs automatically use the PCI\-based serial device\.
+ There is a limit of 100 AFIs per Region\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a Region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\. For more information, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2?](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 FAQ\.
