# Create an Amazon EBS\-backed Linux AMI<a name="creating-an-ami-ebs"></a>

To create an Amazon EBS\-backed Linux AMI, start from an instance that you've launched from an existing Amazon EBS\-backed Linux AMI\. This can be an AMI you have obtained from the AWS Marketplace, an AMI you have created using the [AWS Server Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/) or [VM Import/Export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/what-is-vmimport.html), or any other AMI you can access\. After you customize the instance to suit your needs, create and register a new AMI, which you can use to launch new instances with these customizations\.

The procedures described below work for Amazon EC2 instances backed by encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) volumes \(including the root volume\) as well as for unencrypted volumes\.

The AMI creation process is different for instance store\-backed AMIs\. For information about the differences between Amazon EBS\-backed and instance store\-backed instances, and how to determine the root device type for your instance, see [Storage for the root device](ComponentsAMIs.md#storage-for-the-root-device)\. For information about creating an instance store\-backed Linux AMI, see [Create an instance store\-backed Linux AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md)\.

For information about creating an Amazon EBS\-backed Windows AMI, see [Create an Amazon EBS\-backed Windows AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.

## Overview of creating Amazon EBS\-backed AMIs<a name="process-creating-an-ami-ebs"></a>

The following diagram summarizes the process for creating an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI from a running EC2 instance: Start with an existing AMI, launch an instance, customize it, create a new AMI from it, and finally launch an instance of your new AMI\. The numbers in the diagram match the numbers in the description that follows\.

![\[Workflow for creating an AMI from an instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/running-instance.png)

**1 – AMI \#1: Start with an existing AMI**  
Find an existing AMI that is similar to the AMI that you'd like to create\. This can be an AMI you have obtained from the AWS Marketplace, an AMI you have created using the [AWS Server Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/) or [VM Import/Export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/what-is-vmimport.html), or any other AMI you can access\. You'll customize this AMI for your needs\.  
In the diagram, **EBS root volume snapshot \#1** indicates that the AMI is an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI and that information about the root volume is stored in this snapshot\.

**2 – Launch instance from existing AMI**  
The way to configure an AMI is to launch an instance from the AMI on which you'd like to base your new AMI, and then customize the instance \(indicated at **3** in the diagram\)\. Then, you'll create a new AMI that includes the customizations \(indicated at **4** in the diagram\)\.

**3 – EC2 instance \#1: Customize the instance**  
Connect to your instance and customize it for your needs\. Your new AMI will include these customizations\.  
You can perform any of the following actions on your instance to customize it:  
+ Install software and applications
+ Copy data
+ Reduce start time by deleting temporary files, defragmenting your hard drive, and zeroing out free space
+ Attach additional EBS volumes

**4 – Create image**  
When you create an AMI from an instance, Amazon EC2 powers down the instance before creating the AMI to ensure that everything on the instance is stopped and in a consistent state during the creation process\. If you're confident that your instance is in a consistent state appropriate for AMI creation, you can tell Amazon EC2 not to power down and reboot the instance\. Some file systems, such as XFS, can freeze and unfreeze activity, making it safe to create the image without rebooting the instance\.  
During the AMI\-creation process, Amazon EC2 creates snapshots of your instance's root volume and any other EBS volumes attached to your instance\. You're charged for the snapshots until you [deregister the AMI](deregister-ami.md) and delete the snapshots\. If any volumes attached to the instance are encrypted, the new AMI only launches successfully on instances that support [Amazon EBS encryption](EBSEncryption.md)\.  
Depending on the size of the volumes, it can take several minutes for the AMI\-creation process to complete \(sometimes up to 24 hours\)\. You might find it more efficient to create snapshots of your volumes before creating your AMI\. This way, only small, incremental snapshots need to be created when the AMI is created, and the process completes more quickly \(the total time for snapshot creation remains the same\)\. For more information, see [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](ebs-creating-snapshot.md)\.

**5 – AMI \#2: New AMI**  
After the process completes, you have a new AMI and snapshot \(**snapshot \#2**\) created from the root volume of the instance\. If you added instance\-store volumes or EBS volumes to the instance, in addition to the root device volume, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes\.  
Amazon EC2 automatically registers the AMI for you\.

**6 – Launch instance from new AMI**  
You can use the new AMI to launch an instance\.

**7 – EC2 instance \#2: New instance**  
When you launch an instance using the new AMI, Amazon EC2 creates a new EBS volume for the instance's root volume using the snapshot\. If you added instance\-store volumes or EBS volumes when you customized the instance, the block device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain information for these volumes\. The instance\-store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the new instance are new and don't contain any data from the instance store volumes of the instance you used to create the AMI\. The data on EBS volumes persists\. For more information, see [Block device mappings](block-device-mapping-concepts.md)\.  
When you create a new instance from an EBS\-backed AMI, you should initialize both its root volume and any additional EBS storage before putting it into production\. For more information, see [Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](ebs-initialize.md)\.

## Create a Linux AMI from an instance<a name="how-to-create-ebs-ami"></a>

You can create an AMI using the AWS Management Console or the command line\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To create an AMI from an instance using the console**

1. Start with an existing AMI\.

   1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

   1. In the navigation pane, under **Images**, choose **AMIs**\.

   1. Select an appropriate EBS\-backed AMI to serve as a starting point for your new AMI\.

1. Launch an instance from the AMI\.

   Choose **Launch instance from image** \(new console\) or **Launch** \(old console\) to launch an instance of the EBS\-backed AMI that you've selected\. Accept the default values as you step through the wizard\. For more information, see [Launch an instance using the old launch instance wizard](launching-instance.md)\.

1. Customize the instance\.

   While the instance is running, connect to it\. You can perform any of the following actions on your instance to customize it for your needs:
   + Install software and applications
   + Copy data
   + Reduce start time by deleting temporary files, defragmenting your hard drive, and zeroing out free space
   + Attach additional EBS volumes

   \(Optional\) Create snapshots of all the volumes attached to your instance\. For more information about creating snapshots, see [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](ebs-creating-snapshot.md)\.

1. Create an AMI from the instance\.

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, select your instance, and then choose **Actions**, **Image and templates**, **Create image**\.
**Tip**  
If this option is disabled, your instance isn't an Amazon EBS\-backed instance\.

   1. On the **Create image** page, specify the following information, and then choose **Create image**\.
      + **Image name** – A unique name for the image\.
      + **Image description** – An optional description of the image, up to 255 characters\.
      + **No reboot** – By default, when Amazon EC2 creates the new AMI, it reboots the instance so that it can take snapshots of the attached volumes while data is at rest, in order to ensure a consistent state\. For the **No reboot** setting, you can select the **Enable** check box to prevent Amazon EC2 from shutting down and rebooting the instance\.
**Warning**  
If you choose to enable **No reboot**, we can't guarantee the file system integrity of the created image\.
      + **Instance volumes** – The fields in this section enable you to modify the root volume, and add additional Amazon EBS and instance store volumes\.
        + The root volume is defined in the first row\. To change the size of the root volume, for **Size**, enter the required value\.
        + If you select **Delete on termination**, when you terminate the instance created from this AMI, the EBS volume is deleted\. If you clear **Delete on termination**, when you terminate the instance, the EBS volume is not deleted\. For more information, see [Preserve Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](terminating-instances.md#preserving-volumes-on-termination)\.
        + To add an EBS volume, choose **Add volume** \(which adds a new row\)\. For **Volume type**, choose **EBS**, and fill in the fields in the row\. When you launch an instance from your new AMI, additional volumes are automatically attached to the instance\. Empty volumes must be formatted and mounted\. Volumes based on a snapshot must be mounted\.
        + To add an instance store volume, see [Add instance store volumes to an AMI](add-instance-store-volumes.md#adding-instance-storage-ami)\. When you launch an instance from your new AMI, additional volumes are automatically initialized and mounted\. These volumes do not contain data from the instance store volumes of the running instance on which you based your AMI\.
      + **Tags** – You can tag the AMI and the snapshots with the same tags, or you can tag them with different tags\.
        + To tag the AMI and the snapshots with the *same* tags, choose **Tag image and snapshots together**\. The same tags are applied to the AMI and every snapshot that is created\.
        + To tag the AMI and the snapshots with *different* tags, choose **Tag image and snapshots separately**\. Different tags are applied to the AMI and the snapshots that are created\. However, all the snapshots get the same tags; you can't tag each snapshot with a different tag\.

        To add a tag, choose **Add tag**, and enter the key and value for the tag\. Repeat for each tag\.

   1. To view the status of your AMI while it is being created, in the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**\. Initially, the status is `pending` but should change to `available` after a few minutes\.

1. \(Optional\) To view the snapshot that was created for the new AMI, choose **Snapshots**\. When you launch an instance from this AMI, we use this snapshot to create its root device volume\.

1. Launch an instance from your new AMI\.

   For more information, see [Launch an instance using the old launch instance wizard](launching-instance.md)\.

   The new running instance contains all of the customizations that you applied in the previous steps\.
