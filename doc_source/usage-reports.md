# Amazon EC2 usage reports<a name="usage-reports"></a>

AWS provides a free reporting tool called AWS Cost Explorer that enables you to analyze the cost and usage of your EC2 instances and the usage of your Reserved Instances\. You can view data up to the last 12 months, and forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next three months\. You can use Cost Explorer to see patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time, identify areas that need further inquiry, and see trends that you can use to understand your costs\. You also can specify time ranges for the data, and view time data by day or by month\.

Here's an example of some of the questions that you can answer when using Cost Explorer:
+ How much am I spending on instances of each instance type?
+ How many instance hours are being used by a particular department?
+ How is my instance usage distributed across Availability Zones?
+ How is my instance usage distributed across AWS accounts?
+ How well am I using my Reserved Instances?
+ Are my Reserved Instances helping me save money?
