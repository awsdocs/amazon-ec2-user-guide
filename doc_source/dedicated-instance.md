# Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-instance"></a>

Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer\. Your Dedicated Instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts\. Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances\.

**Note**  
A *Dedicated Host* is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use\. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server\. For more information, see [Dedicated Hosts](dedicated-hosts-overview.md)\.

## Dedicated Instance Basics<a name="dedicated-howitworks"></a>

Each instance that you launch into a VPC has a tenancy attribute\. This attribute has the following values\.


| Tenancy Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `default`  |  Your instance runs on shared hardware\.   | 
|  `dedicated`  |  Your instance runs on single\-tenant hardware\.   | 
|  `host`  | Your instance runs on a Dedicated Host, which is an isolated server with configurations that you can control\. | 

After you launch an instance, there are some limitations to changing its tenancy\.

+ You cannot change the tenancy of an instance from `default` to `dedicated` or `host` after you've launched it\.

+ You cannot change the tenancy of an instance from `dedicated` or `host` to `default` after you've launched it\.

You can change the tenancy of an instance from `dedicated` to `host`, or from `host` to `dedicated` after you've launched it\. For more information, see [Changing the Tenancy of an Instance](#dedicated-change-tenancy)\.

Each VPC has a related instance tenancy attribute\. This attribute has the following values\.


| Tenancy Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `default`  |  An instance launched into the VPC runs on shared hardware by default, unless you explicitly specify a different tenancy during instance launch\.  | 
|  `dedicated`  |  An instance launched into the VPC is a Dedicated Instance by default, unless you explicitly specify a tenancy of `host` during instance launch\. You cannot specify a tenancy of `default` during instance launch\.  | 

You can change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `dedicated` to `default` after you create it\. You cannot change the instance tenancy of a VPC to `dedicated`\.

To create Dedicated Instances, you can do the following:

+ Create the VPC with the instance tenancy set to `dedicated` \(all instances launched into this VPC are Dedicated Instances\)\.

+ Create the VPC with the instance tenancy set to `default`, and specify a tenancy of `dedicated` for any instances when you launch them\.

### Dedicated Instances Limitations<a name="dedicated-limits"></a>

Some AWS services or their features won't work with a VPC with the instance tenancy set to `dedicated`\. Check the service's documentation to confirm if there are any limitations\.

Some instance types cannot be launched into a VPC with the instance tenancy set to `dedicated`\. For more information about supported instances types, see [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/dedicated-instances/)\.

Dedicated instances are physically isolated at an AWS account level\. Therefore, if you have multiple AWS accounts that are connected via a payer account, instances provisioned within the separate accounts will also be isolated (despite being connected via a payer account). 

### Amazon EBS with Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-instance-ebs"></a>

When you launch an Amazon EBS\-backed Dedicated Instance, the EBS volume doesn't run on single\-tenant hardware\.

### Reserved Instances with Dedicated Tenancy<a name="dedicatedreservedinstances"></a>

To guarantee that sufficient capacity is available to launch Dedicated Instances, you can purchase Dedicated Reserved Instances\. For more information, see [Reserved Instances](ec2-reserved-instances.md)\. 

When you purchase a Dedicated Reserved Instance, you are purchasing the capacity to launch a Dedicated Instance into a VPC at a much reduced usage fee; the price break in the usage charge applies only if you launch an instance with dedicated tenancy\. However, if you purchase a Reserved Instance with a default tenancy value, you won't get a Dedicated Reserved Instance if you launch an instance with `dedicated` instance tenancy\.

You can't use the modification process to change the tenancy of a Reserved Instance after you've purchased it\. However, you can exchange a Convertible Reserved Instance for a new Convertible Reserved Instance with a different tenancy\.

### Auto Scaling of Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-instance-autoscaling"></a>

For information about using Auto Scaling to launch Dedicated Instances, see [Auto Scaling in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/autoscalingsubnets.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*\.

### Dedicated Spot Instances<a name="dedicated-instance-spot"></a>

You can run a Dedicated Spot Instance by specifying a tenancy of `dedicated` when you create a Spot Instance request\. For more information, see [Specifying a Tenancy for Your Spot Instances](spot-requests.md#spot-instance-tenancy)\.

### Pricing for Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-instance-pricing"></a>

Pricing for Dedicated Instances is different to pricing for On\-Demand Instances\. For more information, see the [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances product page](https://aws.amazon.com/dedicated-instances)\.

## Working with Dedicated Instances<a name="dedicated-usage-overview"></a>

You can create a VPC with an instance tenancy of `dedicated` to ensure that all instances launched into the VPC are Dedicated Instances\. Alternatively, you can specify the tenancy of the instance during launch\.

### Changing the Tenancy of an Instance<a name="dedicated-change-tenancy"></a>

Depending on your instance type and platform, you can change the tenancy of a stopped Dedicated Instance to `host` after launching it\. The next time the instance starts, it's started on a Dedicated Host that's allocated to your account\. For more information about allocating and working with Dedicated Hosts, and the instance types that can be used with Dedicated Hosts, see [Working with Dedicated Hosts](how-dedicated-hosts-work.md)\. Similarly, you can change the tenancy of a stopped Dedicated Host instance to `dedicated` after launching it\. The next time the instance starts, it's started on single\-tenant hardware that we control\.

**To change the tenancy of an instance using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and select your instance\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Instance State**, **Stop**\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Instance Settings**, **Modify Instance Placement**\.

1. In the **Tenancy** list, choose whether to run your instance on dedicated hardware or on a Dedicated Host\. Choose **Save**\.

**To modify the tenancy value of an instance using the command line**

+ [Edit\-EC2InstancePlacement](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstancePlacement.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

### Changing the Tenancy of a VPC<a name="change-tenancy-vpc"></a>

You can change the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC from `dedicated` to `default`\. Modifying the instance tenancy of the VPC does not affect the tenancy of any existing instances in the VPC\. The next time you launch an instance in the VPC, it has a tenancy of `default`, unless you specify otherwise during launch\.

You cannot change the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC to `dedicated`\.

You can modify the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC using the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the Amazon EC2 API only\.

**To modify the instance tenancy attribute of a VPC using the AWS CLI**

+ Use the [modify\-vpc\-tenancy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-tenancy.html) command to specify the ID of the VPC and instance tenancy value\. The only supported value is `default`\.

  ```
  aws ec2 modify-vpc-tenancy --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d --instance-tenancy default
  ```
