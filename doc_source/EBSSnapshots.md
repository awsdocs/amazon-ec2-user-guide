# Amazon EBS snapshots<a name="EBSSnapshots"></a>

You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point\-in\-time snapshots\. Snapshots are *incremental* backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved\. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data\. Each snapshot contains all of the information that is needed to restore your data \(from the moment when the snapshot was taken\) to a new EBS volume\. 

When you create an EBS volume based on a snapshot, the new volume begins as an exact replica of the original volume that was used to create the snapshot\. The replicated volume loads data in the background so that you can begin using it immediately\. If you access data that hasn't been loaded yet, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then continues loading the rest of the volume's data in the background\. For more information, see [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](ebs-creating-snapshot.md)\.

When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed\. For more information, see [Delete an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-deleting-snapshot.md)\.

**Snapshot events**  
You can track the status of your EBS snapshots through CloudWatch Events\. For more information, see [EBS snapshot events](ebs-cloud-watch-events.md#snapshot-events)\.

**Multi\-volume snapshots**  
Snapshots can be used to create a backup of critical workloads, such as a large database or a file system that spans across multiple EBS volumes\. Multi\-volume snapshots allow you to take exact point\-in\-time, data coordinated, and crash\-consistent snapshots across multiple EBS volumes attached to an EC2 instance\. You are no longer required to stop your instance or to coordinate between volumes to ensure crash consistency, because snapshots are automatically taken across multiple EBS volumes\. For more information, see the steps for creating a multi\-volume EBS snapshot under [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](ebs-creating-snapshot.md) \.

**Snapshot pricing**  
Charges for your snapshots are based on the amount of data stored\. Because snapshots are incremental, deleting a snapshot might not reduce your data storage costs\. Data referenced exclusively by a snapshot is removed when that snapshot is deleted, but data referenced by other snapshots is preserved\. For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Block Store Volumes and Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/checklistforunwantedcharges.html#checkebsvolumes) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*\.

## How incremental snapshots work<a name="how_snapshots_work"></a>

This section shows how an EBS snapshot captures the state of a volume at a point in time, and how successive snapshots of a changing volume create a history of those changes\.

 **Relations among multiple snapshots of the same volume** 

The diagram in this section shows Volume 1 at three points in time\. A snapshot is taken of each of these three volume states\. The diagram specifically shows the following:
+ In State 1, the volume has `10 GiB` of data\. Because **Snap A** is the first snapshot taken of the volume, the entire `10 GiB` of data must be copied\.
+ In State 2, the volume still contains `10 GiB` of data, but `4 GiB` have changed\. **Snap B** needs to copy and store only the `4 GiB` that changed after **Snap A** was taken\. The other `6 GiB` of unchanged data, which are already copied and stored in **Snap A**, are *referenced* by **Snap B** rather than being copied again\. This is indicated by the dashed arrow\.
+ In State 3, `2 GiB` of data have been added to the volume, for a total of `12 GiB`\. **Snap C** needs to copy the `2 GiB` that were added after **Snap B** was taken\. As shown by the dashed arrows, **Snap C** also references `4 GiB` of data stored in **Snap B**, and `6 GiB` of data stored in **Snap A**\. 
+ The total storage required for the three snapshots is `16 GiB`\.

 **Relations among incremental snapshots of different volumes** 

The diagram in this section shows how incremental snapshots can be taken from different volumes\.

**Important**  
The diagram assumes that you own **Vol 1** and that you have created **Snap A**\. If **Vol 1** was owned by another AWS account and that account took **Snap A** and shared it with you, then **Snap B** would be a full snapshot\.

1. **Vol** 1 has `10 GiB` of data\. Because **Snap A** is the first snapshot taken of the volume, the entire `10 GiB` of data is copied and stored\.

1. **Vol 2** is created from **Snap A**, so it is an exact replica of **Vol 1** at the time the snapshot was taken\.

1. Over time, `4 GiB` of data is added to **Vol 2** and its total size becomes `14 GiB`\.

1. **Snap B** is taken from **Vol 2**\. For **Snap B**, only the `4 GiB` of data that was added after the volume was created from **Snap A** is copied and stored\. The other `10 GiB` of unchanged data, which is already stored in **Snap A**, is referenced by **Snap B** instead of being copied and stored again\.

   **Snap B** is an incremental snapshot of **Snap A**, even though it was created from a different volume\.

For more information about how data is managed when you delete a snapshot, see [Delete an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-deleting-snapshot.md)\.

## Copy and share snapshots<a name="copy-and-share"></a>

You can share a snapshot across AWS accounts by modifying its access permissions\. You can make copies of your own snapshots as well as snapshots that have been shared with you\. For more information, see [Share an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\.

A snapshot is constrained to the AWS Region where it was created\. After you create a snapshot of an EBS volume, you can use it to create new volumes in the same Region\. For more information, see [Create a volume from a snapshot](ebs-creating-volume.md#ebs-create-volume-from-snapshot)\. You can also copy snapshots across Regions, making it possible to use multiple Regions for geographical expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery\. You can copy any accessible snapshot that has a `completed` status\. For more information, see [Copy an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-copy-snapshot.md)\.

## Encryption support for snapshots<a name="encryption-support"></a>

EBS snapshots fully support EBS encryption\.
+ Snapshots of encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted\.
+ Volumes that you create from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted\.
+ Volumes that you create from an unencrypted snapshot that you own or have access to can be encrypted on\-the\-fly\.
+ When you copy an unencrypted snapshot that you own, you can encrypt it during the copy process\.
+ When you copy an encrypted snapshot that you own or have access to, you can reencrypt it with a different key during the copy process\.
+ The first snapshot you take of an encrypted volume that has been created from an unencrypted snapshot is always a full snapshot\.
+ The first snapshot you take of a reencrypted volume, which has a different CMK compared to the source snapshot, is always a full snapshot\.

Complete documentation of possible snapshot encryption scenarios is provided in [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](ebs-creating-snapshot.md) and in [Copy an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-copy-snapshot.md)\.
