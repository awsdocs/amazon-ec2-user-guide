# Identity and access management for Amazon EC2<a name="security-iam"></a>

Your security credentials identify you to services in AWS and grant you unlimited use of your AWS resources, such as your Amazon EC2 resources\. You can use features of Amazon EC2 and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to allow other users, services, and applications to use your Amazon EC2 resources without sharing your security credentials\. You can use IAM to control how other users use resources in your AWS account, and you can use security groups to control access to your Amazon EC2 instances\. You can choose to allow full use or limited use of your Amazon EC2 resources\. 

For best practices for securing your AWS resources using IAM, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)\.

## Network access to your instance<a name="intro-to-security-groups"></a>

A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach one or more instances\. When you launch an instance, you assign it one or more security groups\. You add rules to each security group that control traffic for the instance\. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances to which the security group is assigned\. 

For more information, see [Authorize inbound traffic for your Linux instances](authorizing-access-to-an-instance.md)\.

## Amazon EC2 permission attributes<a name="AmazonEC2Permissions"></a>

Your organization might have multiple AWS accounts\. Amazon EC2 enables you to specify additional AWS accounts that can use your Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) and Amazon EBS snapshots\. These permissions work at the AWS account level only; you can't restrict permissions for specific users within the specified AWS account\. All users in the AWS account that you've specified can use the AMI or snapshot\.

Each AMI has a `LaunchPermission` attribute that controls which AWS accounts can access the AMI\. For more information, see [Make an AMI public](sharingamis-intro.md)\.

Each Amazon EBS snapshot has a `createVolumePermission` attribute that controls which AWS accounts can use the snapshot\. For more information, see [Share an Amazon EBS snapshot](ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.md)\.

## IAM and Amazon EC2<a name="intro-to-iam"></a>

IAM enables you to do the following:
+ Create users and groups under your AWS account
+ Assign unique security credentials to each user under your AWS account
+ Control each user's permissions to perform tasks using AWS resources
+ Allow the users in another AWS account to share your AWS resources
+ Create roles for your AWS account and define the users or services that can assume them
+ Use existing identities for your enterprise to grant permissions to perform tasks using AWS resources

By using IAM with Amazon EC2, you can control whether users in your organization can perform a task using specific Amazon EC2 API actions and whether they can use specific AWS resources\.

This topic helps you answer the following questions:
+ How do I create groups and users in IAM?
+ How do I create a policy?
+ What IAM policies do I need to carry out tasks in Amazon EC2?
+ How do I grant permissions to perform actions in Amazon EC2?
+ How do I grant permissions to perform actions on specific resources in Amazon EC2?

### Create an IAM group and users<a name="creating-an-iam-group"></a>

**To create an IAM group**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **User groups**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\. 

1. For **User group name**, enter a name for your group\.

1. For **Attach permissions policies**, select an AWS managed policy\. For example, for Amazon EC2, one of the following AWS managed policies might meet your needs:
   + PowerUserAccess
   + ReadOnlyAccess
   + AmazonEC2FullAccess
   + AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess

1. Choose **Create group**\.

Your new group is listed under **Group name**\.

**To create an IAM user, add the user to your group, and create a password for the user**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose **Add users**\.

1. For **User name**, enter a user name\.

1. For **Select AWS access type**, select both **Access key \- Programmatic access** and **Password \- AWS Management Console access**\.

1. For **Console password**, choose one of the following:
   + **Autogenerated password**\. Each user gets a randomly generated password that meets the current password policy in effect \(if any\)\. You can view or download the passwords when you get to the **Final** page\.
   + **Custom password**\. Each user is assigned the password that you enter in the box\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions** page, choose **Add user to group**\. Select the check box next to the group that you created earlier\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html)\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see all of the choices you made up to this point\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

1. To view the users' access keys \(access key IDs and secret access keys\), choose **Show** next to each password and secret access key to see\. To save the access keys, choose **Download \.csv** and then save the file to a safe location\.
**Important**  
You cannot retrieve the secret access key after you complete this step; if you misplace it you must create a new one\.

1. Provide each user his or her credentials \(access keys and password\); this enables them to use services based on the permissions you specified for the IAM group\. You can choose **Send email** next to each user\. Your local mail client opens with a draft that you can customize and send\. The email template includes the following details to each user:
   + User name
   + URL to the account sign\-in page\. Use the following example, substituting the correct account ID number or account alias:

     ```
     https://AWS-account-ID or alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
     ```

   For more information, see [How IAM users sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_sign-in.html)\.
**Important**  
The user's password is ***not*** included in the generated email\. You must provide them to the user in a way that complies with your organization's security guidelines\.

1. Choose **Close**\.
