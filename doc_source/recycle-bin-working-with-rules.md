# Work with retention rules<a name="recycle-bin-working-with-rules"></a>

To enable and use Recycle Bin, you must create *retention rules* in the AWS Regions in which you want to protect your resources\. Retention rules specify the following:
+ The resource type that you want to protect\.
+ The resources that you want to retain in the Recycle Bin when they are deleted\.
+ The retention period for which to retain resources in the Recycle Bin before they are permanently deleted\.

With Recycle Bin, you can create two types of retention rules:
+ **Tag\-level retention rules** — A tag\-level retention rule uses resource tags to identify the resources that are to be retained in the Recycle Bin\. For each retention rule, you specify one or more tag key and value pairs\. Resources of the specified type that are tagged with at least one of the tag key and value pairs that are specified in the retention rule are automatically retained in the Recycle Bin upon deletion\. Use this type of retention rule if you want to protect specific resources in your account based on their tags\.
+ **Region\-level retention rules** — A Region\-level retention rule does not have any resource tags specified\. It applies to all of the resources of the specified type in the Region in which the rule is created, even if the resources are not tagged\. Use this type of retention rule if you want to protect all resources of a specific type in a specific Region\.

After you create a retention rule, resources that match its criteria are automatically retained in the Recycle Bin for the specified retention period after they are deleted\.

## Create a retention rule<a name="recycle-bin-create-rule"></a>

To create a retention rule, you must specify:
+ An optional name for the retention rule\. The name can be up to 255 characters long\.
+ An optional description for the rule\. The description can be up to 255 characters long\.
+ The resource type that is to be protected by the retention rule\.
+ Resource tags that identify the resources that are to be retained in the Recycle Bin\. You can specify up to 50 tags for each rule\. However, you can add the same tag key and value pair to up to 5 retention rules only\.
  + To create a tag\-level retention rule, specify at least one tag key and value pair\.
  + To create an Region\-level retention rule, do not specify any tag key and value pairs\.
+ The period for which the resources are to be retained in the Recycle Bin after deletion\. The period can be up to 1 year \(365 days\)\.
+ Optional retention rule tags to help identify and organize your retention rules\. You can assign up to 50 tags to each rule\.

Retention rules function only in the Regions in which they are created\. If you intend to use Recycle Bin in other Regions, you must create additional retention rules in those Regions\.

You can create a Recycle Bin retention rule using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ Recycle Bin console ]

**To create a retention rule**

1. Open the Recycle Bin console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rbin/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rbin/home/)

   1. Do one of the following:
      + To create a Region\-level retention rule that matches all deleted resources of the specified type in the Region, select **Apply to all resources**\. The retention rule will retain all deleted resources of the specified in the Recycle Bin upon deletion, even if the resources do not have any tags\.
      + To create a tag\-level retention rule, for **Resource tags to match**, enter the tag key and value pairs to use to identify resource of the specified type that are to be retained in the Recycle Bin\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To create a retention rule**  
Use the [create\-rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rbin/create-rule.html) AWS CLI command\. For `--retention-period`, specify the number of days to retain deleted snapshots in the Recycle Bin\. For `--resource-type`, specify `EBS_SNAPSHOT` for snapshots or `EC2_IMAGE` for AMIs\. To create a tag\-level retention rule, for `--resource-tags`, specify the tags to use to identify the snapshots that are to be retained\. To create a Region\-level retention rule, omit `--resource-tags`\.

```
$ aws rbin create-rule \
--retention-period RetentionPeriodValue=number_of_days,RetentionPeriodUnit=DAYS \
--resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT|EC2_IMAGE \
--description "rule_description" \
--resource-tags ResourceTagKey=tag_key,ResourceTagValue=tag_value
```

**Example 1**  
The following example command creates a Region\-level retention rule that retains all deleted snapshots for a period of `8` days\.

```
$ aws rbin create-rule \
--retention-period RetentionPeriodValue=8,RetentionPeriodUnit=DAYS \
--resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT \
--description "Match all snapshots"
```

**Example 2**  
The following example command creates a tag\-level rule that retains deleted snapshots that are tagged with `purpose=production` for a period of `14` days\.

```
$ aws rbin create-rule \
--retention-period RetentionPeriodValue=14,RetentionPeriodUnit=DAYS \
--resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT \
--description "Match snapshots with a specific tag" \
--resource-tags ResourceTagKey=purpose,ResourceTagValue=production
```

You can view Recycle Bin retention rules using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ Recycle Bin console ]

**To view retention rules**

1. Open the Recycle Bin console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rbin/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rbin/home/)

1. In the navigation panel, choose **Retention rules**\.

1. The grid lists all of the retention rules for the selected Region\. To view more information about a specific retention rule, select it in the grid\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To view all of your retention rules**  
Use the [list\-rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rbin/list-rules.html) AWS CLI command, and for `--resource-type`, specify `EBS_SNAPSHOT` for snapshots or `EC2_IMAGE` for AMIs\.

```
$ aws rbin list-rules --resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT
```

**To view information for a specific retention rule**  
Use the [get\-rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rbin/get-rule.html) AWS CLI command\.

```
$ aws rbin get-rule --identifier rule_ID
```

**Example**  
The following example command provides information about retention rule `pwxIkFcvge4`\.

```
$ aws rbin get-rule --identifier pwxIkFcvge4

------

## Update retention rules<a name="recycle-bin-update-rule"></a>

You can update a retention rule at any time after creation\. You can modify all of a retention rule's parameters, including its description, resource type, resource tags, and retention period\.

After you update a retention rule, the changes only apply to new resources that it retains\. The changes do not affect resources that it previously sent to the Recycle Bin\. For example, if you update a retention rule's retention period, only snapshots that are deleted after the update are retained for the new retention period\. Snapshots that it sent to the Recycle Bin before the update are still retained for the previous \(old\) retention period\.

You can update a retention rule using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ Recycle Bin console ]

```
$ aws rbin update-rule \
--identifier rule_ID \
--retention-period RetentionPeriodValue=number_of_days,RetentionPeriodUnit=DAYS \
--resource-type EBS_SNAPSHOT|EC2_IMAGE \
--description "rule_description"
```
