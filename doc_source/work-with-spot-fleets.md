# Work with Spot Fleets<a name="work-with-spot-fleets"></a>

To start using a Spot Fleet, you create a Spot Fleet request that includes the target capacity, an optional On\-Demand portion, one or more launch specifications for the instances, and the maximum price that you are willing to pay\. The fleet request must include a launch specification that defines the information that the fleet needs to launch an instance, such as an AMI, instance type, subnet or Availability Zone, and one or more security groups\.

If you fleet includes Spot Instances, Amazon EC2 can attempt to maintain your fleet target capacity as Spot prices change\.

It is not possible to modify the target capacity of a one\-time request after it's been submitted\. To change the target capacity, cancel the request and submit a new one\.

A Spot Fleet request remains active until it expires or you cancel it\. When you cancel a fleet request, you can specify whether canceling the request terminates the Spot Instances in that fleet\.

## Spot Fleet request states<a name="spot-fleet-states"></a>

A Spot Fleet request can be in one of the following states:
+ `submitted` – The Spot Fleet request is being evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the target number of instances\.
+ `active` – The Spot Fleet has been validated and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the target number of running Spot Instances\. The request remains in this state until it is modified or canceled\.
+ `modifying` – The Spot Fleet request is being modified\. The request remains in this state until the modification is fully processed or the Spot Fleet is canceled\. A one\-time `request` cannot be modified, and this state does not apply to such Spot requests\.
+ `cancelled_running` – The Spot Fleet is canceled and does not launch additional Spot Instances\. Its existing Spot Instances continue to run until they are interrupted or terminated\. The request remains in this state until all instances are interrupted or terminated\.
+ `cancelled_terminating` – The Spot Fleet is canceled and its Spot Instances are terminating\. The request remains in this state until all instances are terminated\.
+ `cancelled` – The Spot Fleet is canceled and has no running Spot Instances\. The Spot Fleet request is deleted two days after its instances were terminated\.

The following illustration represents the transitions between the request states\. If you exceed your Spot Fleet limits, the request is canceled immediately\.

![\[Spot Fleet request states\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/Spot_fleet_states.png)

## Spot Fleet health checks<a name="spot-fleet-health-checks"></a>

Spot Fleet checks the health status of the Spot Instances in the fleet every two minutes\. The health status of an instance is either `healthy` or `unhealthy`\.

Spot Fleet determines the health status of an instance by using the status checks provided by Amazon EC2\. An instance is determined as `unhealthy` when the status of either the instance status check or the system status check is `impaired` for three consecutive health checks\. For more information, see [Status checks for your instances](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md)\.

You can configure your fleet to replace unhealthy Spot Instances\. After enabling health check replacement, a Spot Instance is replaced when it is reported as `unhealthy`\. The fleet could go below its target capacity for up to a few minutes while an unhealthy Spot Instance is being replaced\.

**Requirements**
+ Health check replacement is supported only for Spot Fleets that maintain a target capacity \(fleets of type `maintain`\), not for one\-time Spot Fleets \(fleets of type `request`\)\.
+ Health check replacement is supported only for Spot Instances\. This feature is not supported for On\-Demand Instances\.
+ You can configure your Spot Fleet to replace unhealthy instances only when you create it\.
+ IAM users can use health check replacement only if they have permission to call the `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus` action\.

------

## Spot Fleet permissions<a name="spot-fleet-prerequisites"></a>

If your IAM users will create or manage a Spot Fleet, you need to grant them the required permissions\.

If you use the Amazon EC2 console to create a Spot Fleet, it creates two service\-linked roles named `AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet` and `AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot`, and a role named `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` that grant the Spot Fleet the permissions to request, launch, terminate, and tag resources on your behalf\. If you use the AWS CLI or an API, you must ensure that these roles exist\.

Use the following instructions to grant the required permissions and create the roles\.

**Topics**
+ [Grant permission to IAM users for Spot Fleet](#spot-fleet-iam-users)
+ [Service\-linked role for Spot Fleet](#service-linked-roles-spot-fleet-requests)
+ [Service\-linked role for Spot Instances](#service-linked-roles-spot-instances)
+ [IAM role for tagging a Spot Fleet](#spot-fleet-service-linked-role)

### Grant permission to IAM users for Spot Fleet<a name="spot-fleet-iam-users"></a>

If your IAM users will create or manage a Spot Fleet, be sure to grant them the required permissions as follows\.

**To grant an IAM user permissions for Spot Fleet**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**, **Create policy**\.

1. On the **Create policy** page, choose **JSON**, and replace the text with the following\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:RunInstances",
                   "ec2:CreateTags",
                   "ec2:RequestSpotFleet",
                   "ec2:ModifySpotFleetRequest",
                   "ec2:CancelSpotFleetRequests",
                   "ec2:DescribeSpotFleetRequests",
                   "ec2:DescribeSpotFleetInstances",
                   "ec2:DescribeSpotFleetRequestHistory"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "iam:PassRole",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                   "iam:ListRoles",
                   "iam:ListInstanceProfiles"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   The preceding example policy grants an IAM user the permissions required for most Spot Fleet use cases\. To limit the user to specific API actions, specify only those API actions instead\.

   **Required EC2 and IAM APIs**

   The following APIs must be included in the policy:
   + `ec2:RunInstances` – Required to launch instances in a Spot Fleet
   + `ec2:CreateTags` – Required to tag the Spot Fleet request, instances, or volumes
   + `iam:PassRole` – Required to specify the Spot Fleet role
   + `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` – Required to create the service\-linked role
   + `iam:ListRoles` – Required to enumerate existing IAM roles
   + `iam:ListInstanceProfiles` – Required to enumerate existing instance profiles
**Important**  
If you specify a role for the IAM instance profile in the launch specification or launch template, you must grant the IAM user the permission to pass the role to the service\. To do this, in the IAM policy include `"arn:aws:iam::*:role/IamInstanceProfile-role"` as a resource for the `iam:PassRole` action\. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

   **Spot Fleet APIs**

   Add the following Spot Fleet API actions to your policy, as needed:
   + `ec2:RequestSpotFleet`
   + `ec2:ModifySpotFleetRequest`
   + `ec2:CancelSpotFleetRequests`
   + `ec2:DescribeSpotFleetRequests`
   + `ec2:DescribeSpotFleetInstances`
   + `ec2:DescribeSpotFleetRequestHistory`

   **Optional IAM APIs**

   \(Optional\) To enable an IAM user to create roles or instance profiles using the IAM console, you must add the following actions to the policy:
   + `iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile`
   + `iam:AttachRolePolicy`
   + `iam:CreateInstanceProfile`
   + `iam:CreateRole`
   + `iam:GetRole`
   + `iam:ListPolicies`

1. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. On the **Review policy** page, enter a policy name and description, and choose **Create policy**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and select the user\.

1. Choose **Permissions**, **Add permissions**\.

1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\. Select the policy that you created earlier and choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Choose **Add permissions**\.

### Service\-linked role for Spot Fleet<a name="service-linked-roles-spot-fleet-requests"></a>

Amazon EC2 uses service\-linked roles for the permissions that it requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service\. Service\-linked roles provide a secure way to delegate permissions to AWS services because only the linked service can assume a service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Using Service\-Linked Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Amazon EC2 uses the service\-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** to launch and manage instances on your behalf\.

**Important**  
If you specify an [encrypted AMI](AMIEncryption.md) or an [encrypted Amazon EBS snapshot](EBSEncryption.md) in your Spot Fleet, you must grant the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** role permission to use the CMK so that Amazon EC2 can launch instances on your behalf\. For more information, see [Grant access to CMKs for use with encrypted AMIs and EBS snapshots](#spot-fleet-service-linked-roles-access-to-cmks)\.

#### Permissions granted by AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet<a name="service-linked-role-permissions-granted-by-AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet"></a>

Amazon EC2 uses **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** to complete the following actions:
+ `ec2:RequestSpotInstances` \- Request Spot Instances
+ `ec2:RunInstances` \- Launch instances
+ `ec2:TerminateInstances` \- Terminate instances
+ `ec2:DescribeImages` \- Describe Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) for the instances
+ `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus` \- Describe the status of the instances
+ `ec2:DescribeSubnets` \- Describe the subnets for the instances
+ `ec2:CreateTags` \- Add tags to the Spot Fleet request, instances, and volumes
+ `elasticloadbalancing:RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer` \- Add the specified instances to the specified load balancer
+ `elasticloadbalancing:RegisterTargets` \- Register the specified targets with the specified target group

#### Create the service\-linked role<a name="service-linked-role-creating-for-spot-fleet"></a>

Under most circumstances, you don't need to manually create a service\-linked role\. Amazon EC2 creates the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** service\-linked role the first time you create a Spot Fleet using the console\. 

If you had an active Spot Fleet request before October 2017, when Amazon EC2 began supporting this service\-linked role, Amazon EC2 created the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** role in your AWS account\. For more information, see [A new role appeared in my AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_roles.html#troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

If you use the AWS CLI or an API to create a Spot Fleet, you must first ensure that this role exists\.

**To create AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet using the console**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. For **Select type of trusted entity**, choose **AWS service**\.

1. Under **Choose a use case**, **Or select a service to view its use cases**, choose **EC2**\.

1. Under **Select your use case**, choose **EC2 \- Spot Fleet**\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the next page, choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. On the next page, choose **Next: Review**\.

1. On the **Review** page, choose **Create role**\.

**To create AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [create\-service\-linked\-role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-service-linked-role.html) command as follows\.

```
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name spotfleet.amazonaws.com
```

If you no longer need to use Spot Fleet, we recommend that you delete the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** role\. After this role is deleted from your account, Amazon EC2 will create the role again if you request a Spot Fleet using the console\. For more information, see [Deleting a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

#### Grant access to CMKs for use with encrypted AMIs and EBS snapshots<a name="spot-fleet-service-linked-roles-access-to-cmks"></a>

If you specify an [encrypted AMI](AMIEncryption.md) or an [encrypted Amazon EBS snapshot](EBSEncryption.md) in your Spot Fleet request and you use a customer managed customer master key \(CMK\) for encryption, you must grant the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** role permission to use the CMK so that Amazon EC2 can launch instances on your behalf\. To do this, you must add a grant to the CMK, as shown in the following procedure\.

When providing permissions, grants are an alternative to key policies\. For more information, see [Using Grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html) and [Using Key Policies in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

**To grant the AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet role permissions to use the CMK**
+ Use the [create\-grant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/create-grant.html) command to add a grant to the CMK and to specify the principal \(the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** service\-linked role\) that is given permission to perform the operations that the grant permits\. The CMK is specified by the `key-id` parameter and the ARN of the CMK\. The principal is specified by the `grantee-principal` parameter and the ARN of the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet** service\-linked role\.

  ```
  aws kms create-grant \
      --region us-east-1 \
      --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:444455556666:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
      --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AWSServiceRoleForEC2SpotFleet \
      --operations "Decrypt" "Encrypt" "GenerateDataKey" "GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext" "CreateGrant" "DescribeKey" "ReEncryptFrom" "ReEncryptTo"
  ```

### Service\-linked role for Spot Instances<a name="service-linked-roles-spot-instances"></a>

Amazon EC2 uses the service\-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** to launch and manage Spot Instances on your behalf\. For more information, see [Service\-linked role for Spot Instance requests](spot-requests.md#service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests)\.

### IAM role for tagging a Spot Fleet<a name="spot-fleet-service-linked-role"></a>

The `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` IAM role grants the Spot Fleet permission to tag the Spot Fleet request, instances, and volumes\. For more information, see [Tag a Spot Fleet](#tag-spot-fleet)\.

**Important**  
If you choose to tag instances in the fleet and you also choose to maintain target capacity \(the Spot Fleet request is of type `maintain`\), the differences in the permissions that are set for the IAM user and the `IamFleetRole` might lead to inconsistent tagging behavior of instances in the fleet\. If the `IamFleetRole` does not include the `CreateTags` permission, some of the instances launched by the fleet might not be tagged\. While we are working to fix this inconsistency, to ensure that all instances launched by the fleet are tagged, we recommend that you use the `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` role for the `IamFleetRole`\. Alternatively, to use an existing role, attach the `AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole` AWS Managed Policy to the existing role\. Otherwise, you need to manually add the `CreateTags` permission to your existing policy\.

**To create the IAM role for tagging a Spot Fleet**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. On the **Select trusted entity** page, under **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS service**\.

1. Under **Use case**, from **Use cases for other AWS services**, choose **EC2**, and then choose **EC2 \- Spot Fleet Tagging**\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Add permissions** page, choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for **Role name**, enter a name for the role \(for example, **aws\-ec2\-spot\-fleet\-tagging\-role**\)\.

1. Review the information on the page, and then choose **Create role**\.

#### Cross\-service confused deputy prevention<a name="cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention"></a>

The [confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more\-privileged entity to perform the action\. We recommend that you use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in the `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` trust policy to limit the permissions that Spot Fleet gives another service to the resource\.

**To add the aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount condition keys to the `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` trust policy**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Find the `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` that you created previously and choose the link \(not the check box\)\.

1. Under **Summary**, choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust policy**\.

1. In the JSON statement, add a `Condition` element containing your `aws:SourceAccount` and `aws:SourceArn` global condition context keys to prevent the [confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html), as follows:

   ```
   "Condition": {
         "ArnLike": {
           "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:account_id:spot-fleet-request/sfr-*"
         },
         "StringEquals": {
           "aws:SourceAccount": "account_id"
         }
   ```
**Note**  
If the `aws:SourceArn` value contains the account ID and you use both global condition context keys, the `aws:SourceAccount` value and the account in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same account ID when used in the same policy statement\.

   The final trust policy will be as follows:

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": {
       "Sid": "ConfusedDeputyPreventionExamplePolicy",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
         "Service": "spotfleet.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
       "Condition": {
         "ArnLike": {
           "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:account_id:spot-fleet-request/sfr-*"
         },
         "StringEquals": {
           "aws:SourceAccount": "account_id"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Update policy**\.

The following table provides potential values for `aws:SourceArn` to limit the scope of the your `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role` in varying degrees of specificity\.


****  

| API operation | Called service | Scope | `aws:SourceArn` |

   1. \(Optional\) For **IAM fleet role**, you can use the default role or choose a different role\. To use the default role after changing the role, choose **Use default role**\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Maximum price**, you can use the default maximum price \(the On\-Demand price\) or specify the maximum price you are willing to pay\. If your maximum price is lower than the Spot price for the instance types that you selected, your Spot Instances are not launched\.

   1. \(Optional\) To create a request that is valid only during a specific time period, edit **Request valid from** and **Request valid until**\.

   1. \(Optional\) By default, we terminate your Spot Instances when the Spot Fleet request expires\. To keep them running after your request expires, clear **Terminate the instances when the request expires**\.

   1. \(Optional\) To register your Spot Instances with a load balancer, choose **Receive traffic from one or more load balancers** and choose one or more Classic Load Balancers or target groups\.

1. For **Minimum compute unit**, choose the minimum hardware specifications \(vCPUs, memory, and storage\) that you need for your application or task, either **as specs** or **as an instance type**\.
   + For **as specs**, specify the required number of vCPUs and amount of memory\.
   + For **as an instance type**, accept the default instance type, or choose **Change instance type** to choose a different instance type\.

1. For **Target capacity**, do the following:

   1. For **Total target capacity**, specify the number of units to request\. For the type of unit, you can choose **Instances**, **vCPUs**, or **Memory \(MiB\)**\. To specify a target capacity of 0 so that you can add capacity later, choose **Maintain target capacity**\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Include On\-Demand base capacity**, specify the number of On\-Demand units to request\. The number must be less than the **Total target capacity**\. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference, and allocates the difference to Spot units to request\.
**Important**  
 To specify optional On\-Demand capacity, you must first choose a launch template\.

   1. \(Optional\) By default, the Spot service terminates Spot Instances when they are interrupted\. To maintain the target capacity, select **Maintain target capacity**\. You can then specify that the Spot service terminates, stops, or hibernates Spot Instances when they are interrupted\. To do so, choose the corresponding option from **Interruption behavior**\.

   1. \(Optional\) To allow Spot Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, select **Capacity rebalance**, and then choose an instance replacement strategy\. If you choose **Launch before terminate**, specify the delay \(in seconds\) before Spot Fleet terminates the old instances\. For more information, see [Capacity Rebalancing](spot-fleet-capacity-rebalance.md)\.

   1. \(Optional\) To control the amount you pay per hour for all the Spot Instances in your fleet, select **Set maximum cost for Spot Instances** and then enter the maximum total amount you're willing to pay per hour\. When the maximum total amount is reached, Spot Fleet stops launching Spot Instances even if it hasn’t met the target capacity\. For more information, see [Control spending](spot-fleet-control-spending.md)\.

1. For **Network**, do the following:

   1. For **Network**, choose an existing VPC or create a new one\.

      \[Existing VPC\] Choose the VPC\.

      \[New VPC\] Choose **Create new VPC** to go the Amazon VPC console\. When you are done, return to the wizard and refresh the list\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Availability Zone**, let AWS choose the Availability Zones for your Spot Instances, or specify one or more Availability Zones\.

      If you have more than one subnet in an Availability Zone, choose the appropriate subnet from **Subnet**\. To add subnets, choose **Create new subnet** to go to the Amazon VPC console\. When you are done, return to the wizard and refresh the list\.

1. For **Instance type requirements**, you can either specify instance attributes and let Amazon EC2 identify the optimal instance types with these attributes, or you can specify a list of instances\. For more information, see [Attribute\-based instance type selection for Spot Fleet](spot-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md)\.

   1. If you choose **Specify instance attributes that match your compute requirements**, specify your instance attributes as follows:

      1. For **vCPUs**, enter the desired minimum and maximum number of vCPUs\. To specify no limit, select **No minimum**, **No maximum**, or both\.

      1. For **Memory \(GiB\)**, enter the desired minimum and maximum amount of memory\. To specify no limit, select **No minimum**, **No maximum**, or both\.

      1. \(Optional\) For **Additional instance attributes**, you can optionally specify one or more attributes to express your compute requirements in more detail\. Each additional attribute adds a further constraint to your request\. You can omit the additional attributes; when omitted, the default values are used\. For a description of each attribute and their default values, see [get\-spot\-placement\-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Command Line Reference*\.

      1. \(Optional\) To view the instance types with your specified attributes, expand **Preview matching instance types**\. To exclude instance types from being used in your request, select the instances and then choose **Exclude selected instance types**\.

   1. If you choose **Manually select instance types**, Spot Fleet provides a default list of instance types\. To select more instance types, choose **Add instance types**, select the instance types to use in your request, and choose **Select**\. To delete instance types, select the instance types and choose **Delete**\.

1. For **Allocation strategy**, choose the strategy that meets your needs\. For more information, see [Allocation strategy for Spot Instances](spot-fleet-allocation-strategy.md)\.

1. For **Your fleet request at a glance**, review your fleet configuration, and make any adjustments if necessary\.

1. \(Optional\) To download a copy of the launch configuration for use with the AWS CLI, choose **JSON config**\.

1. Choose **Launch**\.

   The Spot Fleet request type is `fleet`\. When the request is fulfilled, requests of type `instance` are added, where the state is `active` and the status is `fulfilled`\.

### Create a Spot Fleet using the AWS CLI<a name="create-spot-fleet-cli"></a>

**To create a Spot Fleet request using the AWS CLI**
+ Use the [request\-spot\-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.html) command to create a Spot Fleet request\.

```
aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json
```

For example configuration files, see [Spot Fleet example configurations](spot-fleet-examples.md)\.

The following is example output:

```
{
    "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE"
}
```

## Tag a Spot Fleet<a name="tag-spot-fleet"></a>

To help categorize and manage your Spot Fleet requests, you can tag them with custom metadata\. You can assign a tag to a Spot Fleet request when you create it, or afterward\. You can assign tags using the Amazon EC2 console or a command line tool\.

When you tag a Spot Fleet request, the instances and volumes that are launched by the Spot Fleet are not automatically tagged\. You need to explicitly tag the instances and volumes launched by the Spot Fleet\. You can choose to assign tags to only the Spot Fleet request, or to only the instances launched by the fleet, or to only the volumes attached to the instances launched by the fleet, or to all three\.

**Note**  
Volume tags are only supported for volumes that are attached to On\-Demand Instances\. You can't tag volumes that are attached to Spot Instances\.

For more information about how tags work, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](Using_Tags.md)\.

**Topics**
+ [Prerequisite](#tag-spot-fleet-prereqs)
+ [Tag a new Spot Fleet](#tag-new-spot-fleet)
+ [Tag a new Spot Fleet and the instances and volumes that it launches](#tag-new-spot-fleet-and-resources)
+ [Tag an existing Spot Fleet](#tag-existing-spot-fleet)

### Prerequisite<a name="tag-spot-fleet-prereqs"></a>

Grant the IAM user the permission to tag resources\. For more information, see [Example: Tag resources](ExamplePolicies_EC2.md#iam-example-taggingresources)\.

**To grant an IAM user the permission to tag resources**  
Create a IAM policy that includes the following:
+ The `ec2:CreateTags` action\. This grants the IAM user permission to create tags\.
+ The `ec2:RequestSpotFleet` action\. This grants the IAM user permission to create a Spot Fleet request\.
+ For `Resource`, you must specify `"*"`\. This allows users to tag all resource types\.

```

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "TagSpotFleetRequest",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Important**  
We currently do not support resource\-level permissions for the `spot-fleet-request` resource\. If you specify `spot-fleet-request` as a resource, you will get an unauthorized exception when you try to tag the fleet\. The following example illustrates how *not* to set the policy\.   

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:RequestSpotFleet"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:spot-fleet-request/*"
}
```

### Tag a new Spot Fleet<a name="tag-new-spot-fleet"></a>

**To tag a new Spot Fleet request using the console**

1. Follow the [Create a Spot Fleet request using defined parameters \(console\)](#create-spot-fleet-advanced) procedure\.

1. To add a tag, expand **Additional configurations**, choose **Add new tag**, and enter the key and value for the tag\. Repeat for each tag\.

   For each tag, you can tag the Spot Fleet request and the instances with the same tag\. To tag both, ensure that both **Instance tags** and **Fleet tags** are selected\. To tag only the Spot Fleet request, clear **Instance tags**\. To tag only the instances launched by the fleet, clear **Fleet tags**\.

1. Complete the required fields to create a Spot Fleet request, and then choose **Launch**\. For more information, see [Create a Spot Fleet request using defined parameters \(console\)](#create-spot-fleet-advanced)\.

**To tag a new Spot Fleet request using the AWS CLI**  
To tag a Spot Fleet request when you create it, configure the Spot Fleet request configuration as follows:
+ Specify the tags for the Spot Fleet request in `SpotFleetRequestConfig`\.
+ For `ResourceType`, specify `spot-fleet-request`\. If you specify another value, the fleet request will fail\.
+ For `Tags`, specify the key\-value pair\. You can specify more than one key\-value pair\.

In the following example, the Spot Fleet request is tagged with two tags: Key=Environment and Value=Production, and Key=Cost\-Center and Value=123\.

```

### Tag a new Spot Fleet and the instances and volumes that it launches<a name="tag-new-spot-fleet-and-resources"></a>

**To tag a new Spot Fleet request and the instances and volumes that it launches using the AWS CLI**  
To tag a Spot Fleet request when you create it, and to tag the instances and volumes when they are launched by the fleet, configure the Spot Fleet request configuration as follows:

**Spot Fleet request tags:**
+ Specify the tags for the Spot Fleet request in `SpotFleetRequestConfig`\.
+ For `ResourceType`, specify `spot-fleet-request`\. If you specify another value, the fleet request will fail\.
+ For `Tags`, specify the key\-value pair\. You can specify more than one key\-value pair\.

**Instance tags:**
+ Specify the tags for the instances in `LaunchSpecifications`\.
+ For `ResourceType`, specify `instance`\. If you specify another value, the fleet request will fail\.
+ For `Tags`, specify the key\-value pair\. You can specify more than one key\-value pair\.

  Alternatively, you can specify the tags for the instance in the [launch template](ec2-launch-templates.md#create-launch-template) that is referenced in the Spot Fleet request\.

**Volume tags:**
+ Specify the tags for the volumes in the [launch template](ec2-launch-templates.md#create-launch-template) that is referenced in the Spot Fleet request\. Volume tagging in `LaunchSpecifications` is not supported\.

In the following example, the Spot Fleet request is tagged with two tags: Key=Environment and Value=Production, and Key=Cost\-Center and Value=123\. The instances that are launched by the fleet are tagged with one tag \(which is the same as one of the tags for the Spot Fleet request\): Key=Cost\-Center and Value=123\.

```

        ]
    }
}
```

**To tag instances launched by a Spot Fleet using the AWS CLI**  
To tag instances when they are launched by the fleet, you can either specify the tags in the [launch template](ec2-launch-templates.md#create-launch-template) that is referenced in the Spot Fleet request, or you can specify the tags in the Spot Fleet request configuration as follows:
+ Specify the tags for the instances in `LaunchSpecifications`\.
+ For `ResourceType`, specify `instance`\. If you specify another value, the fleet request will fail\.
+ For `Tags`, specify the key\-value pair\. You can specify more than one key\-value pair\.

In the following example, the instances that are launched by the fleet are tagged with one tag: Key=Cost\-Center and Value=123\.

```

## Modify a Spot Fleet request<a name="modify-spot-fleet"></a>

You can modify an active Spot Fleet request to complete the following tasks:
+ Increase the target capacity and On\-Demand portion
+ Decrease the target capacity and On\-Demand portion

**Note**  
You can't modify a one\-time Spot Fleet request\. You can only modify a Spot Fleet request if you selected **Maintain target capacity** when you created the Spot Fleet request\.

When you increase the target capacity, the Spot Fleet launches additional Spot Instances\. When you increase the On\-Demand portion, the Spot Fleet launches additional On\-Demand Instances\.

When you increase the target capacity, the Spot Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for its Spot Fleet request\. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet launches the instances from the lowest\-priced Spot capacity pool in the Spot Fleet request\. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the pools in the Spot Fleet request\.

When you decrease the target capacity, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity\. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet reaches the new target capacity\. If the allocation strategy is `lowestPrice`, the Spot Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit\. If the allocation strategy is `diversified`, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the pools\. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually\.

When a Spot Fleet terminates an instance because the target capacity was decreased, the instance receives a Spot Instance interruption notice\.

**To modify a Spot Fleet request \(console\)**

1. Open the Spot console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2spot/home/fleet](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot/home/fleet)\.

1. Select your Spot Fleet request\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Modify target capacity**\.

1. In **Modify target capacity**, do the following:

   1. Enter the new target capacity and On\-Demand portion\.

   1. \(Optional\) If you are decreasing the target capacity but want to keep the fleet at its current size, clear **Terminate instances**\.

   1. Choose **Submit**\.

**To modify a Spot Fleet request using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [modify\-spot\-fleet\-request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-spot-fleet-request.html) command to update the target capacity of the specified Spot Fleet request\.

```
aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request \
    --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --target-capacity 20
```

You can modify the previous command as follows to decrease the target capacity of the specified Spot Fleet without terminating any Spot Instances as a result\.

```
aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request \
    --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --target-capacity 10 \
    --excess-capacity-termination-policy NoTermination
```

## Cancel a Spot Fleet request<a name="cancel-spot-fleet"></a>

When you are finished using your Spot Fleet, you can cancel the Spot Fleet request\. This cancels all Spot requests associated with the Spot Fleet, so that no new Spot Instances are launched for your Spot Fleet\. You must specify whether the Spot Fleet should terminate its Spot Instances\. If you terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_terminating` state\. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters the `cancelled_running` state and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually\.

**To cancel a Spot Fleet request \(console\)**

1. Open the Spot console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2spot/home/fleet](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot/home/fleet)\.

1. Select your Spot Fleet request\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Cancel spot request**\.

1. In **Cancel spot request**, verify that you want to cancel the Spot Fleet\. To keep the fleet at its current size, clear **Terminate instances**\. When you are ready, choose **Confirm**\.

**To cancel a Spot Fleet request using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [cancel\-spot\-fleet\-requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/cancel-spot-fleet-requests.html) command to cancel the specified Spot Fleet request and terminate the instances\.

```
aws ec2 cancel-spot-fleet-requests \
    --spot-fleet-request-ids sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --terminate-instances
```

The following is example output:

```
{
    "SuccessfulFleetRequests": [
        {
            "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE",
            "CurrentSpotFleetRequestState": "cancelled_terminating",
            "PreviousSpotFleetRequestState": "active"
        }
    ],
    "UnsuccessfulFleetRequests": []
}
```

You can modify the previous command as follows to cancel the specified Spot Fleet request without terminating the instances\.

```
aws ec2 cancel-spot-fleet-requests \
    --spot-fleet-request-ids sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --no-terminate-instances
```

The following is example output:

```
{
    "SuccessfulFleetRequests": [
        {
            "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE",
            "CurrentSpotFleetRequestState": "cancelled_running",
            "PreviousSpotFleetRequestState": "active"
        }
    ],
    "UnsuccessfulFleetRequests": []
}
```
