# Amazon EC2 Mac instances<a name="ec2-mac-instances"></a>

Mac1 instances natively support the macOS operating system\. They are built on Mac mini hardware and powered by 3\.2 GHz Intel eighth\-generation \(Coffee Lake\) Core i7 processors\. These instances are ideal for developing, building, testing, and signing applications for Apple devices, such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV\. You can connect to your Mac instance using SSH or Apple Remote Desktop \(ARD\)\.

**Note**  
The **unit of billing** is the **dedicated host**\. The instances running on top of that host have no additional charge\.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Mac Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/mac) and [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/mac/#Pricing)\.

## Considerations<a name="mac-instance-considerations"></a>

The following considerations apply to Mac instances:
+ Mac instances are available only as bare metal instances on [Dedicated Hosts](dedicated-hosts-overview.md), with a minimum allocation period of 24 hours before you can release the Dedicated Host\. You can launch one Mac instance per Dedicated Host\. You can share the Dedicated Host with the AWS accounts or organizational units within your AWS organization, or the entire AWS organization\.
+ Mac instances are available only as On\-Demand Instances\. They are not available as Spot Instances or Reserved Instances\. You can save money on Mac instances by purchasing a [Savings Plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/)\.
+ Mac instances can run one of the following operating systems:
  + macOS Catalina \(version 10\.15\)
  + macOS Mojave \(version 10\.14\)
  + macOS Big Sur \(version 11\)
  + macOS Monterey \(version 12\)
+ If you attach an EBS volume to a running Mac instance, you must reboot the instance to make the volume available\.
+ If you resized an existing EBS volume on a running Mac instance, you must reboot the instance to make the new size available\.
+ If you attach a network interface to a running Mac instance, you must reboot the instance to make the network interface available\.
+ AWS does not manage or support the internal SSD on the Apple hardware\. We strongly recommend that you use Amazon EBS volumes instead\. EBS volumes provide the same elasticity, availability, and durability benefits on Mac instances as they do on any other EC2 instance\.
+ We recommend using General Purpose SSD \(`gp2` and `gp3`\) and Provisioned IOPS SSD \(`io1` and `io2`\) with Mac instances for optimal EBS performance\.
+ [Mac instances now support Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\.](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-autoscaling-for-ec2-mac-instances/) 
+ Automatic software updates are disabled\. We recommend that you apply updates and test them on your instance before you put the instance into production\. For more information, see [Update the operating system and software](#mac-instance-updates)\.
+ When you stop or terminate a Mac instance, a scrubbing workflow is performed on the Dedicated Host\. For more information, see [Stop and terminate your Mac instance](#mac-instance-stop)\.
+ 
**Warning**  
Do not use FileVault\. If data\-at\-rest and data\-in\-transit is required, use [EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) to avoid boot issues and performance impact\. Enabling FileVault will result in the host failing to boot due to the partitions being locked\. 

## Launch a Mac instance using the console<a name="mac-instance-launch"></a>

You can launch a Mac instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the following procedure\. Mac instances require a [Dedicated Host](dedicated-hosts-overview.md)\.

**To launch a Mac instance onto a Dedicated Host**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**\.

1. Choose **Allocate Dedicated Host** and then do the following:

   1. For **Instance family**, choose **mac1**\. If **mac1** doesn’t appear in the list, it’s not supported in the currently selected Region\.

   1. For **Instance type**, select **mac1\.metal**\.

   1. For **Availability Zone**, choose the Availability Zone for the Dedicated Host\.

   1. For **Quantity**, keep **1**\.

   1. Choose **Allocate**\.

1. Select the Dedicated Host that you created and then do the following:

   1. Choose **Actions**, **Launch instances onto host**\.

   1. Select a macOS AMI\.

   1. Select the `mac1.metal` instance type\.

   1. On the **Configure Instance Details page**, verify that **Tenancy** and **Host** are preconfigured based on the Dedicated Host you created\. Update **Affinity** as needed\.

   1. Complete the wizard, specifying EBS volumes, security groups, and key pairs as needed\.

1. A confirmation page lets you know that your instance is launching\. Choose **View Instances** to close the confirmation page and return to the console\. The initial state of an instance is `pending`\. The instance is ready when its state changes to `running` and it passes status checks\.

## Launch a Mac instance using the AWS CLI<a name="mac-instance-launch-cli"></a>

Use the following [allocate\-hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) command to allocate a Dedicated Host for your Mac instance\.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts --region us-east-1 --instance-type mac1.metal --availability-zone us-east-1b --auto-placement "on" --quantity 1
```

Use the following [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command to launch a Mac instance\.

```
aws ec2 run-instances --region us-east-1 --instance-type mac1.metal --placement Tenancy=host --image-id ami_id --key-name my-key-pair
```

The initial state of an instance is `pending`\. The instance is ready when its state changes to `running` and it passes status checks\. Use the following [describe\-instance\-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.html) command to display status information for your instance:

```
aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-017f8354e2dc69c4f
```

The following is example output for an instance that is running and has passed status checks\.

```
{
    "InstanceStatuses": [
        {
            "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1b",
            "InstanceId": "i-017f8354e2dc69c4f",
            "InstanceState": {
                "Code": 16,
                "Name": "running"
            },
            "InstanceStatus": {
                "Details": [
                    {
                        "Name": "reachability",
                        "Status": "passed"
                    }
                ],
                "Status": "ok"
            },
            "SystemStatus": {
                "Details": [
                    {
                        "Name": "reachability",
                        "Status": "passed"
                    }
                ],
                "Status": "ok"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Connect to your instance using SSH<a name="mac-instance-ssh"></a>

**Important**  
Multiple users can access the OS simultaneously, however please review the appropriate [macOS SLA](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/) with your counsel to confirm workload compliance\. Typically there is a 1:1 user:GUI session due to the built\-in Screen Sharing service on port 5900\. Using SSH within macOS supports multiple sessions up until the "Max Sessions" limit in sshd\_config file\.

Amazon EC2 Mac instances do not allow remote root SSH by default\. Password authentication is disabled to prevent brute\-force password attacks\. The ec2\-user account is configured to log in remotely using SSH\. The ec2\-user account also has sudo privileges\. After you connect to your instance, you can add other users\.

To support connecting to your instance using SSH, launch the instance using a key pair and a security group that allows SSH access, and ensure that the instance has internet connectivity\. You provide the `.pem` file for the key pair when you connect to the instance\.

Use the following procedure to connect to your Mac instance using an SSH client\. If you receive an error while attempting to connect to your instance, see [Troubleshoot connecting to your instance](TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.md)\.

**To connect to your instance using SSH**

1. Verify that your local computer has an SSH client installed by entering ssh at the command line\. If your computer doesn't recognize the command, search for an SSH client for your operating system and install it\.

1. Get the public DNS name of your instance\. Using the Amazon EC2 console, you can find the public DNS name on both the **Details** and the **Networking** tabs\. Using the AWS CLI, you can find the public DNS name using the [describe\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command\.

1. Locate the `.pem` file for the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance\.

1. Connect to your instance using the following ssh command, specifying the public DNS name of the instance and the `.pem` file\.

   ```
   ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@my-instance-public-dns-name
   ```

## Connect to your instance using Apple Remote Desktop<a name="mac-instance-vnc"></a>

Use the following procedure to connect to your instance using Apple Remote Desktop \(ARD\)\.

**Note**  
macOS 10\.14 and later only allows control if Screen Sharing is enabled through [System Preferences](https://support.apple.com/guide/remote-desktop/enable-remote-management-apd8b1c65bd/mac)\.

**To connect to your instance using ARD**

1. Verify that your local computer has an ARD client or a VNC client that supports ARD installed\. On macOS, you can leverage the built\-in Screen Sharing application\. Otherwise, search for ARD for your operating system and install it\.

1. From your local computer, [connect to your instance using SSH](#mac-instance-ssh)\.

1. Set up a password for the ec2\-user account using the passwd command as follows\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo passwd ec2-user
   ```

1. Start the Apple Remote Desktop agent and enable remote desktop access as follows\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart \
   -activate -configure -access -on \
   -restart -agent -privs -all
   ```

1. From your computer, connect to your instance using the following ssh command\. In addition to the options shown in the previous section, use the \-L option to enable port forwarding and forward all traffic on local port 5900 to the ARD server on the instance\.

   ```
   ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@my-instance-public-dns-name
   ```

1. From your local computer, use the ARD client or VNC client that supports ARD to connect to localhost on port 5900\. For example, use the Screen Sharing application on macOS as follows:

   1. Open Finder and launch the Screen Sharing application\.

   1. For **Connect to**, enter **localhost**\.

   1. Log in as prompted, using **ec2\-user** as the user name and the password that you created for the ec2\-user account\.

## Modify macOS screen resolution on Mac instances<a name="mac-screen-resolution"></a>

Once you connect to your EC2 Mac instance using ARD or a VNC client that supports ARD installed, you can modify the screen resolution of your macOS environment using any of the publicly available macOS tools or utilities, such as [displayplacer](https://github.com/jakehilborn/displayplacer)

**Modifying screen resolution using displayplacer**

1. Install displayplacer\.

   ```
   brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer
   ```

1. Show current screen info and possible screen resolutions\.

   ```
   displayplacer list
   ```

1. Apply desired screen resolution\.

   ```
   displayplacer "id:<screenID> res:<width>x<height> origin:(0,0) degree:0"
   ```

   For example:

   ```
   RES="2560x1600"
   displayplacer "id:69784AF1-CD7D-B79B-E5D4-60D937407F68 res:${RES} scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0"
   ```

## EC2 macOS AMIs<a name="ec2-macos-images"></a>

Amazon EC2 macOS is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high\-performance environment for developer workloads running on Amazon EC2 Mac instances\. EC2 macOS AMIs includes packages that enable easy integration with AWS, such as launch configuration tools and popular AWS libraries and tools\. EC2 macOS AMIs include the following by default:
+ ENA drivers
+ EC2 macOS Init
+ EC2 System Monitoring for macOS
+ SSM Agent for macOS
+ AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) version 2
+ Command Line Tools for Xcode
+ Homebrew

AWS provides updated EC2 macOS AMIs on a regular basis that include updates to AWS\-owned packages and the latest fully\-tested macOS version\. Additionally, AWS provides updated AMIs with the latest minor version updates or major version updates as soon as they can be fully tested and vetted\. If you do not need to preserve data or customizations to your Mac instances, you can get the latest updates by launching a new instance using the current AMI and then terminating the previous instance\. Otherwise, you can choose which updates to apply to your Mac instances\.

## Update the operating system and software<a name="mac-instance-updates"></a>

You can install operating system updates from Apple using the softwareupdate command\.

**To install operating system updates from Apple**

1. List the packages with available updates using the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ softwareupdate --list
   ```

1. Install all updates or only specific updates\. To install specific updates, use the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo softwareupdate --install label
   ```

   To install all updates instead, use the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo softwareupdate --install --all
   ```

System administrators can use AWS Systems Manager to roll out pre\-approved operating system updates\. For more information, see the [AWS Systems Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/)\.

You can use Homebrew to install updates to packages in the EC2 macOS AMIs, so that you have the latest version of these packages on your instances\. You can also use Homebrew to install and run common macOS applications on Amazon EC2 macOS\. For more information, see the [Homebrew Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/)\.

**To install updates using Homebrew**

1. Update Homebrew using the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ brew update
   ```

1. List the packages with available updates using the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ brew outdated
   ```

1. Install all updates or only specific updates\. To install specific updates, use the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ brew upgrade formula
   ```

   To install all updates instead, use the following command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ brew upgrade
   ```

**Warning**  
Do not install beta or prerelease macOS versions on your EC2 Mac instances, as this configuration is currently not supported\. Installing beta or prerelease macOS versions will lead to degradation of your EC2 Mac Dedicated Host when you stop or terminate your instance, and will prevent you from starting or launching a new instance on that host\. 

## EC2 macOS Init<a name="ec2-macos-init"></a>

EC2 macOS Init is used to initialize EC2 Mac instances at launch\. It uses priority groups to run logical groups of tasks at the same time\.

The launchd plist file is `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.amazon.ec2.macos-init.plist`\. The files for EC2 macOS Init are located in `/usr/local/aws/ec2-macos-init`\.

For more information, see [https://github\.com/aws/ec2\-macos\-init](https://github.com/aws/ec2-macos-init)\.

## EC2 System Monitoring for macOS<a name="mac-instance-system-monitor"></a>

EC2 System Monitoring for macOS provides CPU utilization metrics to Amazon CloudWatch\. It sends these metrics to CloudWatch over a custom serial device in 1\-minute periods\. You can enable or disable this agent as follows\. It is enabled by default\.

```
sudo setup-ec2monitoring [enable | disable]
```

## Increase the size of an EBS volume on your Mac instance<a name="mac-instance-increase-volume"></a>

You can increase the size of your Amazon EBS volumes on your Mac instance\. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](ebs-modify-volume.md)\.

After you increase the size of the volume, you must increase the size of your APFS container as follows\.

**Make increased disk space available for use**

1. Determine if a restart is needed\. If you resized an existing EBS volume on a running Mac instance, you must [reboot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-reboot.html) the instance to make the new size available\. If disk space modification was done during launch time, a reboot will not be needed\. 

   View current status of disk sizes: 

   ```
    [ec2-user ~]$ diskutil list external physical
   /dev/disk0 (external, physical):
      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
      0:                 GUID_partition_scheme            *322.1 GB     disk0
      1:                 EFI EFI                           209.7 MB     disk0s1
      2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2        321.9 GB     disk0s2
   ```

1. Copy and paste the following command\.

   ```
   PDISK=$(diskutil list physical external | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f1)
   APFSCONT=$(diskutil list physical external | grep "Apple_APFS" | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f8)
   yes | sudo diskutil repairDisk $PDISK
   ```

1. Copy and paste the following command\.

   ```
   sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer $APFSCONT 0
   ```

## Stop and terminate your Mac instance<a name="mac-instance-stop"></a>

When you stop a Mac instance, the instance remains in the `stopping` state for about 15 minutes before it enters the `stopped` state\.

When you stop or terminate a Mac instance, Amazon EC2 performs a scrubbing workflow on the underlying Dedicated Host to erase the internal SSD, to clear the persistent NVRAM variables, and if needed, to update the bridgeOS software on the underlying Mac mini\. This ensures that Mac instances provide the same security and data privacy as other EC2 Nitro instances\. It also enables you to run the latest macOS AMIs without manually updating the bridgeOS software\. During the scrubbing workflow, the Dedicated Host temporarily enters the `pending` state\. If the bridgeOS software does not need to be updated, the scrubbing workflow takes up to 50 minutes to complete\. If the bridgeOS software needs to be updated, the scrubbing workflow can take up to 3 hours to complete\.

You can't start the stopped Mac instance or launch a new Mac instance until after the scrubbing workflow completes, at which point the Dedicated Host enters the `available` state\.

Metering and billing is paused when the Dedicated Host enters the `pending` state\. You are not charged for the duration of the scrubbing workflow\.

## Subscribe to macOS AMI notifications<a name="subscribe-notifications"></a>

To be notified when new AMIs are released or when bridgeOS has been updated, subscribe for notifications using Amazon SNS\.

**To subscribe to macOS AMI notifications**

1. Open the Amazon SNS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/sns/v3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home)\.

1. In the navigation bar, change the Region to **US East \(N\. Virginia\)**, if necessary\. You must use this Region because the SNS notifications that you are subscribing to were created in this Region\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subscriptions**\.

1. Choose **Create subscription**\.

1. For the **Create subscription** dialog box, do the following:

   1. For **Topic ARN**, copy and paste one of the following Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\):
