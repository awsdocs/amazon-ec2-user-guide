# Start a hibernated instance<a name="hibernating-resuming"></a>

Start a hibernated instance by starting it in the same way that you would start a stopped instance\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To start a hibernated instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select a hibernated instance, and choose **Instance state**, **Start instance**\. It can take a few minutes for the instance to enter the `running` state\. During this time, the instance [status checks](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md#types-of-instance-status-checks) show the instance in a failed state until the instance has started\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]
