# Resources and tags<a name="EC2_Resources"></a>

Amazon EC2 provides different *resources* that you can create and use\. Some of these resources include images, instances, volumes, and snapshots\. When you create a resource, we assign the resource a unique resource ID\.

Some resources can be tagged with values that you define, to help you organize and identify them\.

The following topics describe resources and tags, and how you can work with them\.
