# Required IAM permissions<a name="snapshot-archiving-iam"></a>

By default, users don't have permission to use snapshot archiving\. To allow users to use snapshot archiving, you must create IAM policies that grant permission to use specific resources and API actions\. For more information, see [Creating IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the IAM User Guide\.

To use snapshot archiving, users need the following permissions\.
+ `ec2:DescribeSnapshotTierStatus`
+ `ec2:ModifySnapshotTier`
+ `ec2:RestoreSnapshotTier`

Console users might need additional permissions such as `ec2:DescribeSnapshots`\.

To archive and restore encrypted snapshots, the following additional AWS KMS permissions are required\.
+ `kms:CreateGrant`
+ `kms:Decrypt`
+ `kms:DescribeKey`

The following is an example IAM policy that gives IAM users permission to archive, restore, and view encrypted and unencrypted snapshots\. It includes the `ec2:DescribeSnapshots` permission for console users\. If some permissions are not needed, you can remove them from the policy\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeSnapshotTierStatus",
            "ec2:ModifySnapshotTier",
            "ec2:RestoreSnapshotTier",
            "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
            "kms:CreateGrant",
            "kms:Decrypt",
            "kms:DescribeKey"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }]
}
```

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:
+ Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\):

  Create a permission set\. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.
+ Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

  Create a role for identity federation\. Follow the instructions in [Creating a role for a third\-party identity provider \(federation\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ IAM users:
  + Create a role that your user can assume\. Follow the instructions in [Creating a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
  + \(Not recommended\) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group\. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
