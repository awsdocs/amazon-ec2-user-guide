# Set up EC2 Instance Connect<a name="ec2-instance-connect-set-up"></a>

To use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to an instance, you need to configure every instance that will support using Instance Connect \(this is a one\-time requirement for each instance\), and you need to grant permission to every IAM user/role that will use Instance Connect\.

**Topics**
+ [Task 1: Configure network access to an instance](#ec2-instance-connect-setup-security-group)
+ [Task 2: \(Conditional\) Install EC2 Instance Connect on an instance](#ec2-instance-connect-install)
+ [Task 3: \(Optional\) Install the EC2 Instance Connect CLI](#ec2-instance-connect-install-eic-CLI)
+ [Task 4: Configure IAM permissions for EC2 Instance Connect](#ec2-instance-connect-configure-IAM-role)

For more information about setting up EC2 Instance Connect, see [Securing your bastion hosts with Amazon EC2 Instance Connect](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/infrastructure-and-automation/securing-your-bastion-hosts-with-amazon-ec2-instance-connect/)\.

**Limitations**
+ The following Linux distributions are supported:
  + Amazon Linux 2 \(any version\)
  + Ubuntu 16\.04 or later
+ If you configured the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` settings for SSH authentication, the EC2 Instance Connect installation will not update them\. As a result, you cannot use Instance Connect\.

**Prerequisites**
+ **Verify the general prerequisites for connecting to your instance using SSH\.**

  For more information, see [General prerequisites for connecting to your instance](connection-prereqs.md)\.
+ **Install an SSH client on your local computer\.**

  Your local computer most likely has an SSH client installed by default\. You can check for an SSH client by typing ssh at the command line\. If your local computer doesn't recognize the command, you can install an SSH client\. For information about installing an SSH client on Linux or macOS X, see [http://www\.openssh\.com](http://www.openssh.com/)\. For information about installing an SSH client on Windows 10, see [OpenSSH in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview)\.
+ **Install the AWS CLI on your local computer\.**

  To configure the IAM permissions, you must use the AWS CLI\. For more information about installing the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
+ **\[Ubuntu\] Install the AWS CLI on your instance\.**

  To install EC2 Instance Connect on an Ubuntu instance, you must use the AWS CLI on the instance\. For more information about installing the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

## Task 1: Configure network access to an instance<a name="ec2-instance-connect-setup-security-group"></a>

You must configure the following network access to your instance so that you can install EC2 Instance Connect and enable your users to connect to your instance:
+ Ensure that the security group associated with your instance [allows inbound SSH traffic](authorizing-access-to-an-instance.md#add-rule-authorize-access) on port 22 from your IP address\. The default security group for the VPC does not allow incoming SSH traffic by default\. The security group created by the launch wizard allows incoming SSH traffic by default\. For more information, see [Authorizing inbound traffic for your Linux instances](authorizing-access-to-an-instance.md)\.
+ \(Browser\-based client\) We recommend that your instance allows inbound SSH traffic from the [recommended IP block published for the service](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)\. Use the `EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT` filter for the `service` parameter to get the IP address ranges in the EC2 Instance Connect subset\. For more information, see [AWS IP Address Ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## Task 2: \(Conditional\) Install EC2 Instance Connect on an instance<a name="ec2-instance-connect-install"></a>

Amazon Linux 2 2\.0\.20190618 or later and Ubuntu 20\.04 or later are preconfigured with EC2 Instance Connect\. If you launched your instance using one of these AMIs, you can skip this task\. For other supported Linux distributions, you must install Instance Connect on every instance that will support connecting using Instance Connect\.

Installing Instance Connect configures the SSH daemon on the instance\. The procedure for installing Instance Connect is different for instances launched using Amazon Linux 2 and Ubuntu\.

------
#### [ Amazon Linux 2 ]

**To install EC2 Instance Connect on an instance launched with Amazon Linux 2**

1. Connect to your instance using SSH\.

   Use the SSH key pair that was assigned to your instance when you launched it and the default user name of the AMI that you used to launch your instance\. For Amazon Linux 2, the default user name is `ec2-user`\.

   For example, if your instance was launched using Amazon Linux 2, your instance's public DNS name is `ec2-a-b-c-d.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`, and the key pair is `my_ec2_private_key.pem`, use the following command to SSH into your instance:

   ```
   $ ssh -i my_ec2_private_key.pem ec2-user@ec2-a-b-c-d.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
   ```

   For more information about connecting to your instance, see [Connecting to your Linux instance using SSH](AccessingInstancesLinux.md)\.

1. Install the EC2 Instance Connect package on your instance\.

   For Amazon Linux 2, use the yum install command\.

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install ec2-instance-connect
   ```

   You should see four new files in the `/opt/aws/bin/` folder:

   ```
   eic_curl_authorized_keys
   eic_harvest_hostkeys
   eic_parse_authorized_keys
   eic_run_authorized_keys
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Verify that Instance Connect was successfully installed on your instance\.

   Use the sudo less command to check that the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file was correctly updated as follows:

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ sudo less /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

   Instance Connect was successfully installed if the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` lines in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file contain the following values:

   ```
   AuthorizedKeysCommand /opt/aws/bin/eic_run_authorized_keys %u %f
   AuthorizedKeysCommandUser ec2-instance-connect
   ```
   + `AuthorizedKeysCommand` sets the `eic_run_authorized_keys` file to look up the keys from the instance metadata
   + `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` sets the system user as `ec2-instance-connect`
**Note**  
If you previously configured `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser`, the Instance Connect installation will not change the values and you will not be able to use Instance Connect\.

------
#### [ Ubuntu ]

**To install EC2 Instance Connect on an instance launched with Ubuntu 16\.04 or later**

1. Connect to your instance using SSH\.

   Use the SSH key pair that was assigned to your instance when you launched it and use the default user name of the AMI that you used to launch your instance\. For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu`\.

   If your instance was launched using Ubuntu, your instance's public DNS name is `ec2-a-b-c-d.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`, and the key pair is `my_ec2_private_key.pem`, use the following command to SSH into your instance:

   ```
   $ ssh -i my_ec2_private_key.pem ubuntu@ec2-a-b-c-d.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
   ```

   For more information about connecting to your instance, see [Connecting to your Linux instance using SSH](AccessingInstancesLinux.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) Ensure your instance has the latest Ubuntu AMI\.

   For Ubuntu, use the following commands to update all the packages on your instance\.

   ```
   ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update
   ```

   ```
   ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

1. Install the Instance Connect package on your instance\.

   For Ubuntu, use the sudo apt\-get command to install the `.deb` package\.

   ```
   ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ec2-instance-connect
   ```

   You should see four new files in the `/usr/share/ec2-instance-connect/` folder:

   ```
   eic_curl_authorized_keys
   eic_harvest_hostkeys
   eic_parse_authorized_keys
   eic_run_authorized_keys
   ```

1. \(Optional\) Verify that Instance Connect was successfully installed on your instance\.

   Use the sudo less command to check that the `/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service.d/ec2-instance-connect.conf` was correctly updated as follows:

   ```
   ubuntu:~$ sudo less /lib/systemd/system/ssh.service.d/ec2-instance-connect.conf
   ```

   Instance Connect was successfully installed if the `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` lines in the `/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service.d/ec2-instance-connect.conf` file contain the following values:

   ```
   AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/share/ec2-instance-connect/eic_run_authorized_keys %u %f
   AuthorizedKeysCommandUser ec2-instance-connect
   ```
   + `AuthorizedKeysCommand` sets the `eic_run_authorized_keys` file to look up the keys from the instance metadata
   + `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` sets the system user as `ec2-instance-connect`
**Note**  
If you previously configured `AuthorizedKeysCommand` and `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser`, the Instance Connect installation will not change the values and you will not be able to use Instance Connect\.

------

For more information about the EC2 Instance Connect package, see [aws/aws\-ec2\-instance\-connect\-config ](https://github.com/aws/aws-ec2-instance-connect-config) on the GitHub website\.

## Task 3: \(Optional\) Install the EC2 Instance Connect CLI<a name="ec2-instance-connect-install-eic-CLI"></a>

The EC2 Instance Connect CLI provides a similar interface to standard SSH calls, which includes querying EC2 instance information, generating and publishing ephemeral public keys, and establishing an SSH connection through a single command, `mssh instance_id`\.

**Note**  
There is no need to install the EC2 Instance Connect CLI if users will only use the browser\-based client or an SSH client to connect to an instance\.

**To install the EC2 Instance Connect CLI package**  
Use `[pip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-pip)` to install the `ec2instanceconnectcli` package\. For more information, see [aws/aws\-ec2\-instance\-connect\-cli ](https://github.com/aws/aws-ec2-instance-connect-cli) on the GitHub website, and [https://pypi\.org/project/ec2instanceconnectcli/](https://pypi.org/project/ec2instanceconnectcli/) on the Python Package Index \(PyPI\) website\.

```
$ pip install ec2instanceconnectcli
```

## Task 4: Configure IAM permissions for EC2 Instance Connect<a name="ec2-instance-connect-configure-IAM-role"></a>

For an IAM users or IAM role to connect to an instance using EC2 Instance Connect, you must grant the IAM user or IAM role permission to push the public key to the instance\. You grant the permission by creating an IAM policy and attaching the policy to the IAM users or IAM roles that require the permission\. For more information, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonec2instanceconnect.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

The following instructions explain how to create the policy and attach it using the AWS CLI\. For instructions that use the AWS Management Console, see [Creating IAM Policies \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-start) and [Adding Permissions by Attaching Policies Directly to the User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-directly-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**To grant an IAM user permission for EC2 Instance Connect \(AWS CLI\)**

1. Create a JSON policy document that includes the following:
   + The `ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey` action\. This grants an IAM user permission to push the public key to an instance\. With `ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey`, consider restricting access to specific EC2 instances\. Otherwise, all IAM users with this permission can connect to all EC2 instances\.
   + The `ec2:osuser` condition\. This specifies the name of the OS user that can push the public key to an instance\. Use the default user name for the AMI that you used to launch the instance\. The default user name for Amazon Linux 2 is `ec2-user`, and for Ubuntu it's `ubuntu`\.
   + The `ec2:DescribeInstances` action\. This is required when using the EC2 Instance Connect CLI because the wrapper calls this action\. IAM users might already have permission to call this action from another policy\.

   The following is an example policy document\. You can omit the statement for the `ec2:DescribeInstances` action if your users will only use an SSH client to connect to your instances\. You can replace the specified instances in `Resource` with the wildcard `*` to grant users access to all EC2 instances using EC2 Instance Connect\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",
           "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0",
               "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-0598c7d356eba48d7"
           ],
           "Condition": {
               "StringEquals": {
                   "ec2:osuser": "ami-username"
               }
           }
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
   }
   ```

   The preceding policy allows access to specific instances, identified by their instance ID\. Alternatively, you can use resource tags to control access to an instance\. Attribute\-based access control is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on tags that can be attached to users and AWS resources\. For example, the following policy allows an IAM user to access an instance only if that instance has a resource tag with key=`tag-key` and value=`tag-value`\. For more information about using tags to control access to your AWS resources, see [Controlling Access to AWS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html#access_tags_control-resources) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

   ```
   { 
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement":[ 
         { 
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/*",
            "Condition":{ 
               "StringEquals":{ 
                  "aws:ResourceTag/tag-key":"tag-value"
               }
            }
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```

1. Use the [create\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.html) command to create a new managed policy, and specify the JSON document that you created to use as the content for the new policy\.

   ```
   $ aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://JSON-file-name
   ```

1. Use the [attach\-user\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-user-policy.html) command to attach the managed policy to the specified IAM user\. For the `--user-name` parameter, specify the friendly name \(not the ARN\) of the IAM user\.

   ```
   $ aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/my-policy --user-name IAM-friendly-name
   ```

**To grant an IAM role permission for EC2 Instance Connect \(AWS CLI\)**   

1. Create a JSON policy document that includes the following:
   + The `ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey` action\. This grants an IAM role permission to push the public key to an instance\. With `ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey`, consider restricting access to specific EC2 instances\. Otherwise, all IAM roles with this permission can connect to all EC2 instances\.
   + The `ec2:DescribeInstances` action\. This is required when using the EC2 Instance Connect CLI because the wrapper calls this action\. IAM roles might already have permission to call this action from another policy\.

   The following is an example policy document\. You can omit the statement for the `ec2:DescribeInstances` action if your roles will only use an SSH client to connect to your instances\. You can replace the specified instances in `Resource` with the wildcard `*` to grant users access to all EC2 instances using EC2 Instance Connect\.

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey",

               "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0",
               "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/i-0598c7d356eba48d7"
           ]
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
   }
   ```
1. Use the [create\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.html) command to create a new managed policy, and specify the JSON document that you created to use as the content for the new policy\.

   ```
   $ aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://JSON-file-name
   ```

1. Use the [attach\-role\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-role-policy.html) command to attach the managed policy to the specified IAM role\. For the `--role-name` parameter, specify the friendly name \(not the ARN\) of the IAM role\.

   ```
   $ aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/my-policy --role-name IAM-friendly-name
   ```
