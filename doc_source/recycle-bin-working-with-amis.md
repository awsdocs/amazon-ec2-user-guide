# Recover AMIs from the Recycle Bin<a name="recycle-bin-working-with-amis"></a>

Recycle Bin is a data recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS\-backed AMIs\. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify before being permanently deleted\.

You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires\. After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin and you can use it in the same way that you use any other resource of that type in your account\. If the retention period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and it is no longer available for recovery\.

AMIs in the Recycle Bin do not incur any additional charges\.

For more information, see [Recycle Bin](recycle-bin.md)\.

## Permissions for working with AMIs in the Recycle Bin<a name="ami-perms"></a>

By default, IAM users don't have permission to work with AMIs that are in the Recycle Bin\. To allow IAM users to work with these resources, you must create IAM policies that grant permission to use specific resources and API actions\. You then attach those policies to the IAM users or the groups that require those permissions\.

To view and recover AMIs that are in the Recycle Bin, AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) users must have the following permissions:
+ `ec2:ListImagesInRecycleBin`
+ `ec2:RestoreImageFromRecycleBin`

To manage tags for AMIs in the Recycle Bin, IAM users need the following additional permissions\.
+ `ec2:CreateTags`
+ `ec2:DeleteTags`

To use the Recycle Bin console, IAM users need the `ec2:DescribeTags` permission\.

The following is an example IAM policy\. It includes the `ec2:DescribeTags` permission for console users, and it includes the `ec2:CreateTags` and `ec2:CreateTags` permissions for managing tags\. If the permissions are not needed, you can remove them from the policy\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:ListImagesInRecycleBin", 
            "ec2:RestoreImageFromRecycleBin"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "ec2:CreateTags",
            "ec2:DeleteTags",
            "ec2:DescribeTags"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:Region::image/*"
      }    
    ]
}
```

## View AMIs in the Recycle Bin<a name="recycle-bin-view-ami"></a>

While an AMI is in the Recycle Bin, you can view limited information about it, including:
+ The name, description, and unique ID of the AMI\.
+ The date and time when the AMI was deleted and it entered Recycle Bin\.
+ The date and time when the retention period expires\. The AMI will be permanently deleted at this time\.

You can view the AMIs in the Recycle Bin using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ Recycle Bin console ]

**To view deleted AMIs in the Recycle Bin using the console**

1. Open the Recycle Bin console at [console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rbin/home/](console.aws.amazon.com/rbin/home/)

1. In the navigation panel, choose **Recycle Bin**\.

1. The grid lists all of the resources that are currently in the Recycle Bin\. To view the details for a specific AMI, select it in the grid, and choose **Actions**, **View details**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To view deleted AMIs in the Recycle Bin using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [ list\-images\-in\-recycle\-bin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/list-images-in-recycle-bin.html) AWS CLI command\. To view specific AMIs, include the `--image-id` option and specify the IDs of the AMIs to view\. You can specify up to 20 IDs in a single request\.

To view all of the AMIs in the Recycle Bin, omit the `--image-id` option\. If you do not specify a value for `--max-items`, the command returns 1,000 items per page, by default\. For more information, see [ Pagination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#api-pagination) in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference*\.

```
$ aws ec2 list-images-in-recycle-bin --image-id ami_id
```

For example, the following command provides information about AMI `ami-01234567890abcdef` in the Recycle Bin\.

```
$ aws ec2 list-images-in-recycle-bin --image-id ami-01234567890abcdef
```

Example output:

```
{
    "Images": [
        {
            "ImageId": "ami-0f740206c743d75df",
            "Name": "My AL2 AMI",
            "Description": "My Amazon Linux 2 AMI",
            "RecycleBinEnterTime": "2021-11-26T21:04:50+00:00",
            "RecycleBinExitTime": "2022-03-06T21:04:50+00:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Restore AMIs from the Recycle Bin<a name="recycle-bin-restore-ami"></a>

You can't use an AMI in any way while it is in the Recycle Bin\. To use the AMI, you must first restore it\. When you restore an AMI from the Recycle Bin, the AMI is immediately available for use, and it is removed from the Recycle Bin\. You can use a restored AMI in the same way that you use any other AMI in your account\.

You can restore an AMI from the Recycle Bin using one of the following methods\.

------
#### [ Recycle Bin console ]

**To restore an AMI from the Recycle Bin using the console**

1. Open the Recycle Bin console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com//rbin/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com//rbin/home/)

1. In the navigation panel, choose **Recycle Bin**\.

1. The grid lists all of the resources that are currently in the Recycle Bin\. Select the AMI to restore, and choose **Recover**\.

1. When prompted, choose **Recover**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To restore a deleted AMI from the Recycle Bin using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [ restore\-image\-from\-recycle\-bin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/restore-image-from-recycle-bin.html) AWS CLI command\. For `--image-id`, specify the ID of the AMI to restore\.

```
$ aws ec2 restore-image-from-recycle-bin --image-id ami_id
```

For example, the following command restores AMI `ami-01234567890abcdef` from the Recycle Bin\.

```
$ aws restore-image-from-recycle-bin --image-id ami-01234567890abcdef
```

The command returns no output on success\.
