# Amazon CloudWatch Events for Amazon EBS<a name="ebs-cloud-watch-events"></a>

Amazon EBS emits notifications based on Amazon CloudWatch Events for a variety of volume, snapshot, and encryption status changes\. With CloudWatch Events, you can establish rules that trigger programmatic actions in response to a change in volume, snapshot, or encryption key state\. For example, when a snapshot is created, you can trigger an AWS Lambda function to share the completed snapshot with another account or copy it to another Region for disaster\-recovery purposes\.

Events in CloudWatch are represented as JSON objects\. The fields that are unique to the event are contained in the "detail" section of the JSON object\. The "event" field contains the event name\. The "result" field contains the completed status of the action that triggered the event\. For more information, see [Event Patterns in CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEventsandEventPatterns.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide*\.

For more information, see [Using Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Topics**
+ [createVolume](#create-volume)
+ [deleteVolume](#delete-volume)
+ [attachVolume](#attach-fail-key)



### Create volume \(createVolume\)<a name="create-volume"></a>

The `createVolume` event is sent to your AWS account when an action to create a volume completes\. However it is not saved, logged, or archived\. This event can have a result of either `available` or `failed`\. Creation will fail if an invalid AWS KMS key was provided, as shown in the examples below\.

**Event data**  
The listing below is an example of a JSON object emitted by EBS for a successful `createVolume` event\. 

```
{
   "version": "0",
   "id": "01234567-0123-0123-0123-012345678901",
   "detail-type": "EBS Volume Notification",
   "source": "aws.ec2",
   "account": "012345678901",

   "region": "us-east-1",
   "resources": [
      "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:012345678901:volume/vol-01234567"
   ],
   "detail": {
      "result": "available",
      "cause": "",
      "event": "createVolume",
      "request-id": "01234567-0123-0123-0123-0123456789ab"
   }
}
```

The listing below is an example of a JSON object emitted by EBS after a failed `createVolume` event\. The cause for the failure was a disabled KMS key\.

```
{
  "version": "0",

    "result": "failed",
    "cause": "arn:aws:kms:sa-east-1:0123456789ab:key/01234567-0123-0123-0123-0123456789ab is disabled.",
    "request-id": "01234567-0123-0123-0123-0123456789ab",
  }
}
```

The following is an example of a JSON object that is emitted by EBS after a failed `createVolume` event\. The cause for the failure was a KMS key pending import\.

```

  }
}
```

### Delete volume \(deleteVolume\)<a name="delete-volume"></a>

The `deleteVolume` event is sent to your AWS account when an action to delete a volume completes\. However it is not saved, logged, or archived\. This event has the result `deleted`\. If the deletion does not complete, the event is never sent\.

**Event data**  
The listing below is an example of a JSON object emitted by EBS for a successful `deleteVolume` event\. 

```
{
   "version": "0",
   "id": "01234567-0123-0123-0123-012345678901",

   }
}
```

### Volume attach or reattach \(attachVolume, reattachVolume\)<a name="attach-fail-key"></a>

The `attachVolume` or `reattachVolume` event is sent to your AWS account if a volume fails to attach or reattach to an instance\. However it is not saved, logged, or archived\. If you use a KMS key to encrypt an EBS volume and the KMS key becomes invalid, EBS will emit an event if that KMS key is later used to attach or reattach to an instance, as shown in the examples below\.

**Event data**  
The listing below is an example of a JSON object emitted by EBS after a failed `attachVolume` event\. The cause for the failure was a KMS key pending deletion\.

**Note**  
AWS may attempt to reattach to a volume following routine server maintenance\.

## EBS Snapshots Archive events<a name="snapshot-archive-events"></a>

Amazon EBS emits events related to snapshot archiving actions\. For more information, see [Monitor snapshot archiving](monitor-snapshot-archiving.md)\.

## EBS fast snapshot restore events<a name="fast-snapshot-restore-events"></a>

Amazon EBS sends events to CloudWatch Events when the state of fast snapshot restore for a snapshot changes\. Events are emitted on a best effort basis\.

The following is example data for this event\.

```
{
   "version": "0",
   "id": "01234567-0123-0123-0123-012345678901",
   "detail-type": "EBS Fast Snapshot Restore State-change Notification",
   "source": "aws.ec2",
   "account": "123456789012",
   "time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
   "region": "us-east-1",
   "resources": [
      "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1::snapshot/snap-03a55cf56513fa1b6"
   ],
   "detail": {
      "snapshot-id": "snap-1234567890abcdef0",
      "state": "optimizing",
      "zone": "us-east-1a",
      "message": "Client.UserInitiated - Lifecycle state transition",
   }
}
```

The possible values for `state` are `enabling`, `optimizing`, `enabled`, `disabling`, and `disabled`\.

The possible values for `message` are as follows:

`Client.InvalidSnapshot.InvalidState - The requested snapshot transitioned to an invalid state (Error)`  
A request to enable fast snapshot restore failed and the state transitioned to `disabling` or `disabled`\. Fast snapshot restore cannot be enabled for this snapshot\.

`Client.UserInitiated`  
The state successfully transitioned to `enabling` or `disabling`\.

`Client.UserInitiated - Lifecycle state transition`  
The state successfully transitioned to `optimizing`, `enabled`, or `disabled`\.

`Server.InsufficientCapacity - There was insufficient capacity available to satisfy the request`  
A request to enable fast snapshot restore failed due to insufficient capacity, and the state transitioned to `disabling` or `disabled`\. Wait and then try again\.

`Server.InternalError - An internal error caused the operation to fail`  
A request to enable fast snapshot restore failed due to an internal error, and the state transitioned to `disabling` or `disabled`\. Wait and then try again\.

`Client.InvalidSnapshot.InvalidState - The requested snapshot was deleted or access permissions were revoked`  
The fast snapshot restore state for the snapshot has transitioned to `disabling` or `disabled` because the snapshot was deleted or unshared by the snapshot owner\. Fast snapshot restore cannot be enabled for a snapshot that has been deleted or is no longer shared with you\.

## Using AWS Lambda to handle CloudWatch events<a name="using_lambda"></a>

You can use Amazon EBS and CloudWatch Events to automate your data\-backup workflow\. This requires you to create an IAM policy, a AWS Lambda function to handle the event, and an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule that matches incoming events and routes them to the Lambda function\.

The following procedure uses the `createSnapshot` event to automatically copy a completed snapshot to another Region for disaster recovery\. 

**To copy a completed snapshot to another Region**

1. Create an IAM policy, such as the one shown in the following example, to provide permissions to use the `CopySnapshot` action and write to the CloudWatch Events log\. Assign the policy to the IAM user that will handle the CloudWatch event\.

   ```

     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",

1. Define a function in Lambda that will be available from the CloudWatch console\. The sample Lambda function below, written in Node\.js, is invoked by CloudWatch when a matching `createSnapshot` event is emitted by Amazon EBS \(signifying that a snapshot was completed\)\. When invoked, the function copies the snapshot from `us-east-2` to `us-east-1`\.

   ```
   // Sample Lambda function to copy an EBS snapshot to a different Region
    
   var AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   var ec2 = new AWS.EC2();
    
   // define variables
   var destinationRegion = 'us-east-1';
   var sourceRegion = 'us-east-2';
   console.log ('Loading function');
    
   //main function
   exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    
       // Get the EBS snapshot ID from the CloudWatch event details
       var snapshotArn = event.detail.snapshot_id.split('/');
       const snapshotId = snapshotArn[1];
       const description = `Snapshot copy from ${snapshotId} in ${sourceRegion}.`;
       console.log ("snapshotId:", snapshotId);
   
       // Load EC2 class and update the configuration to use destination Region to initiate the snapshot.
       AWS.config.update({region: destinationRegion});
       var ec2 = new AWS.EC2();
   
       // Prepare variables for ec2.modifySnapshotAttribute call
       const copySnapshotParams = {
           Description: description,
           DestinationRegion: destinationRegion,
           SourceRegion: sourceRegion,
           SourceSnapshotId: snapshotId
       };
    
       // Execute the copy snapshot and log any errors
       ec2.copySnapshot(copySnapshotParams, (err, data) => {
           if (err) {
               const errorMessage = `Error copying snapshot ${snapshotId} to Region ${destinationRegion}.`;
               console.log(errorMessage);
               console.log(err);
               callback(errorMessage);
           } else {
               const successMessage = `Successfully started copy of snapshot ${snapshotId} to Region ${destinationRegion}.`;
               console.log(successMessage);
               console.log(data);
               callback(null, successMessage);
           }
       });
   };
   ```

   To ensure that your Lambda function is available from the CloudWatch console, create it in the Region where the CloudWatch event will occur\. For more information, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/)\.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation panel, expand **Events** and choose **Rules**, and then choose **Create rule**\.

1. Select **Event Pattern\.**\. For **Service Name**, choose **EC2**, and for **Event Type**, choose **EBS Snapshot Notification**\.

1. Select **Specific event\(s\)** and then choose **createSnapshot**\.

1. Select **Specific result\(s\)** and then choose **succeeded**\.

1. In the **Targets** section, choose **Add target**, and then for **Function**, choose the Lambda function that you created previously\.

1. Choose **Configure details**\.

1. On the **Configure rule details** page, enter values for **Name** and **Description**\. Select the **State** check box to activate the function\.

1. Choose **Create rule**\.

Your rule should now appear on the **Rules** tab\. In the example shown, the event that you configured should be emitted by EBS the next time you copy a snapshot\.
