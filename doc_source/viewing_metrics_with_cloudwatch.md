# List the available CloudWatch metrics for your instances<a name="viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon EC2 sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch\. You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an API to list the metrics that Amazon EC2 sends to CloudWatch\. By default, each data point covers the 5 minutes that follow the start time of activity for the instance\. If you've enabled detailed monitoring, each data point covers the next minute of activity from the start time\. Note that for the Minimum, Maximum, and Average statistics, the minimum granularity for the metrics that EC2 provides is 1 minute\.

For information about getting the statistics for these metrics, see [Get statistics for metrics for your instances](monitoring_get_statistics.md)\.

## Instance metrics<a name="ec2-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following instance metrics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| CPUUtilization |  The percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use on the instance\. This metric identifies the processing power required to run an application on a selected instance\. Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can show a different percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not allocated a full processor core\. Units: Percent  | 
| DiskReadOps |  Completed read operations from all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time\. To calculate the average I/O operations per second \(IOPS\) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period\. If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported\. Units: Count  | 
| DiskWriteOps |  Completed write operations to all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time\. To calculate the average I/O operations per second \(IOPS\) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period\. If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported\. Units: Count  | 
| DiskReadBytes |  Bytes read from all instance store volumes available to the instance\. This metric is used to determine the volume of the data the application reads from the hard disk of the instance\. This can be used to determine the speed of the application\. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\. If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported\. Units: Bytes  | 
| DiskWriteBytes |  Bytes written to all instance store volumes available to the instance\. This metric is used to determine the volume of the data the application writes onto the hard disk of the instance\. This can be used to determine the speed of the application\. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\. If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported\.  Units: Bytes  | 
| MetadataNoToken |  The number of times the instance metadata service was successfully accessed using a method that does not use a token\. This metric is used to determine if there are any processes accessing instance metadata that are using Instance Metadata Service Version 1, which does not use a token\. If all requests use token\-backed sessions, i\.e\., Instance Metadata Service Version 2, the value is 0\. For more information, see [Transition to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](configuring-instance-metadata-service.md#instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2)\. Units: Count  | 
| NetworkIn |  The number of bytes received by the instance on all network interfaces\. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to a single instance\. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, divide it by 60\. Units: Bytes  | 
| NetworkOut |  The number of bytes sent out by the instance on all network interfaces\. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from a single instance\. The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, you can divide this number by 300 to find Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, divide it by 60\. Units: Bytes  | 
| NetworkPacketsIn |  The number of packets received by the instance on all network interfaces\. This metric identifies the volume of incoming traffic in terms of the number of packets on a single instance\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only \(5\-minute periods\)\. To calculate the number of packets per second \(PPS\) your instance received for the 5 minutes, divide the Sum statistic value by 300\. Units: Count  | 
| NetworkPacketsOut |  The number of packets sent out by the instance on all network interfaces\. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing traffic in terms of the number of packets on a single instance\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only \(5\-minute periods\)\. To calculate the number of packets per second \(PPS\) your instance received for the 5 minutes, divide the Sum statistic value by 300\. Units: Count  | 

## CPU credit metrics<a name="cpu-credit-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following CPU credit metrics for your [burstable performance instances](burstable-performance-instances.md)\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| CPUCreditUsage |  The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU utilization\. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100% utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs, utilization, and time \(for example, one vCPU running at 50% utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25% utilization for two minutes\)\. CPU credit metrics are available at a 5\-minute frequency only\. If you specify a period greater than five minutes, use the `Sum` statistic instead of the `Average` statistic\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUCreditBalance |  The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started\. For T2 Standard, the `CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch credits that have been accrued\. Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they are earned, and removed from the credit balance when they are spent\. The credit balance has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size\. After the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded\. For T2 Standard, launch credits do not count towards the limit\. The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization\. When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` do not expire\. When a T3 or T3a instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` value persists for seven days\. Thereafter, all accrued credits are lost\. When a T2 instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` value does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost\. CPU credit metrics are available at a 5\-minute frequency only\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUSurplusCreditBalance  |  The number of surplus credits that have been spent by an `unlimited` instance when its `CPUCreditBalance` value is zero\. The `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` value is paid down by earned CPU credits\. If the number of surplus credits exceeds the maximum number of credits that the instance can earn in a 24\-hour period, the spent surplus credits above the maximum incur an additional charge\. CPU credit metrics are available at a 5\-minute frequency only\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)   | 
| CPUSurplusCreditsCharged |  The number of spent surplus credits that are not paid down by earned CPU credits, and which thus incur an additional charge\. Spent surplus credits are charged when any of the following occurs:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html) CPU credit metrics are available at a 5\-minute frequency only\. Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 

## Dedicated Host metrics<a name="dh-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following metrics for T3 Dedicated Hosts\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  DedicatedHostCPUUtilization |  The percentage of allocated compute capacity that is currently in use by the instances running on the Dedicated Host\. Unit: Percent  | 

## Amazon EBS metrics for Nitro\-based instances<a name="ebs-metrics-nitro"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following Amazon EBS metrics for the Nitro\-based instances\. For the list of Nitro\-based instance types, see [Instances built on the Nitro System](instance-types.md#ec2-nitro-instances)\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  EBSReadOps |  Completed read operations from all Amazon EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time\. To calculate the average read I/O operations per second \(Read IOPS\) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to calculate the Read IOPS\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\.  Unit: Count  | 
|  EBSWriteOps  |  Completed write operations to all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time\. To calculate the average write I/O operations per second \(Write IOPS\) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to calculate the Write IOPS\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\. Unit: Count  | 
|  EBSReadBytes  |  Bytes read from all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time\.  The number reported is the number of bytes read during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Read Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\.  Unit: Bytes  | 
|  EBSWriteBytes  |  Bytes written to all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time\. The number reported is the number of bytes written during the period\. If you are using basic \(5\-minute\) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Write Bytes/second\. If you have detailed \(1\-minute\) monitoring, divide it by 60\.  Unit: Bytes  | 
|  EBSIOBalance%  |  Provides information about the percentage of I/O credits remaining in the burst bucket\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only\. Instance sizes that support this metric can be found in the table under [EBS optimized by default](ebs-optimized.md#current): the instances in the **Instance size** column that include an asterisk \(\*\) support this metric\.  The `Sum` statistic is not applicable to this metric\. Unit: Percent  | 
|  EBSByteBalance%  |  Provides information about the percentage of throughput credits remaining in the burst bucket\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only\. Instance sizes that support this metric can be found in the table under [EBS optimized by default](ebs-optimized.md#current): the instances in the **Instance size** column that include an asterisk \(\*\) support this metric\.  The `Sum` statistic is not applicable to this metric\. Unit: Percent  | 

For information about the metrics provided for your EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS metrics](using_cloudwatch_ebs.md#ebs-metrics)\. For information about the metrics provided for your Spot fleets, see [CloudWatch metrics for Spot Fleet](spot-fleet-cloudwatch-metrics.md)\.

## Status check metrics<a name="status-check-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following status check metrics\. By default, status check metrics are available at a 1\-minute frequency at no charge\. For a newly\-launched instance, status check metric data is only available after the instance has completed the initialization state \(within a few minutes of the instance entering the running state\)\. For more information about EC2 status checks, see [Status checks for your instances](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md)\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| StatusCheckFailed |  Reports whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check in the last minute\. This metric can be either 0 \(passed\) or 1 \(failed\)\. By default, this metric is available at a 1\-minute frequency at no charge\. Units: Count  | 
| StatusCheckFailed\_Instance |  Reports whether the instance has passed the instance status check in the last minute\. This metric can be either 0 \(passed\) or 1 \(failed\)\. By default, this metric is available at a 1\-minute frequency at no charge\. Units: Count  | 
| StatusCheckFailed\_System |  Reports whether the instance has passed the system status check in the last minute\. This metric can be either 0 \(passed\) or 1 \(failed\)\. By default, this metric is available at a 1\-minute frequency at no charge\. Units: Count  | 

## Traffic mirroring metrics<a name="traffic-mirroring-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes metrics for mirrored traffic\. For more information, see [Monitor mirrored traffic using Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirror-cloudwatch.html) in the *Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring Guide*\.

## Amazon EC2 metric dimensions<a name="ec2-cloudwatch-dimensions"></a>

You can use the following dimensions to refine the metrics listed in the previous tables\.


|  Dimension  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  AutoScalingGroupName  |  This dimension filters the data you request for all instances in a specified capacity group\. An *Auto Scaling group* is a collection of instances you define if you're using Auto Scaling\. This dimension is available only for Amazon EC2 metrics when the instances are in such an Auto Scaling group\. Available for instances with Detailed or Basic Monitoring enabled\.  | 
|  ImageId  |  This dimension filters the data you request for all instances running this Amazon EC2 Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\. Available for instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled\.  | 
|  InstanceId  |  This dimension filters the data you request for the identified instance only\. This helps you pinpoint an exact instance from which to monitor data\.  | 
|  InstanceType  |  This dimension filters the data you request for all instances running with this specified instance type\. This helps you categorize your data by the type of instance running\. For example, you might compare data from an m1\.small instance and an m1\.large instance to determine which has the better business value for your application\. Available for instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled\.  | 

## Amazon EC2 usage metrics<a name="service-quota-metrics"></a>

You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources\. Use these metrics to visualize your current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards\.

Amazon EC2 usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas\. You can configure alarms that alert you when your usage approaches a service quota\. For more information about CloudWatch integration with service quotas, see [AWS usage metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Service-Quota-Integration.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

Amazon EC2 publishes the following metrics in the `AWS/Usage` namespace\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `ResourceCount` |  The number of the specified resources running in your account\. The resources are defined by the dimensions associated with the metric\. The most useful statistic for this metric is `MAXIMUM`, which represents the maximum number of resources used during the 1\-minute period\.  | 

The following dimensions are used to refine the usage metrics that are published by Amazon EC2\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Service  |  The name of the AWS service containing the resource\. For Amazon EC2 usage metrics, the value for this dimension is `EC2`\.  | 
|  Type  |  The type of entity that is being reported\. Currently, the only valid value for Amazon EC2 usage metrics is `Resource`\.  | 
|  Resource  |  The type of resource that is running\. Currently, the only valid value for Amazon EC2 usage metrics is `vCPU`, which returns information on instances that are running\.  | 
|  Class  |  The class of resource being tracked\. For Amazon EC2 usage metrics with `vCPU` as the value of the `Resource` dimension, the valid values are `Standard/OnDemand`, `F/OnDemand`, `G/OnDemand`, `Inf/OnDemand`, `P/OnDemand`, and `X/OnDemand`\. The values for this dimension define the first letter of the instance types that are reported by the metric\. For example, `Standard/OnDemand` returns information about all running instances with types that start with A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, and Z, and `G/OnDemand` returns information about all running instances with types that start with G\.  | 

## List metrics using the console<a name="list-ec2-metrics-console"></a>

Metrics are grouped first by namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\. For example, you can view all metrics provided by Amazon EC2, or metrics grouped by instance ID, instance type, image \(AMI\) ID, or Auto Scaling group\.
