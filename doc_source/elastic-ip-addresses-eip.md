# Elastic IP addresses<a name="elastic-ip-addresses-eip"></a>

An *Elastic IP address* is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing\. An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it\. By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account\. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance\. For more information, see the documentation for your domain registrar, or [Set up dynamic DNS on your Amazon Linux instance](dynamic-dns.md)\.

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet\. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet\. For example, this allows you to connect to your instance from your local computer\.

## Elastic IP address pricing<a name="eip-pricing"></a>

To ensure efficient use of Elastic IP addresses, we impose a small hourly charge if an Elastic IP address is not associated with a running instance, or if it is associated with a stopped instance or an unattached network interface\. While your instance is running, you are not charged for one Elastic IP address associated with the instance, but you are charged for any additional Elastic IP addresses associated with the instance\.

For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses on the [Amazon EC2 Pricing, On\-Demand Pricing page](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)\.

## Elastic IP address basics<a name="eip-basics"></a>

The following are the basic characteristics of an Elastic IP address:
+ An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time\.
+ An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region\.
+ An Elastic IP address comes from Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses, or from a custom IPv4 address pool that you have brought to your AWS account\.
+ To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account, and then associate it with your instance or a network interface\.
+ When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance, it is also associated with the instance's primary network interface\. When you associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface that is attached to an instance, it is also associated with the instance\.
+ When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or its primary network interface, the instance's public IPv4 address \(if it had one\) is released back into Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses\. You cannot reuse a public IPv4 address, and you cannot convert a public IPv4 address to an Elastic IP address\. For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses)\.
+ You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from a resource, and then associate it with a different resource\. To avoid unexpected behavior, ensure that all active connections to the resource named in the existing association are closed before you make the change\. After you have associated your Elastic IP address to a different resource, you can reopen your connections to the newly associated resource\.
+ A disassociated Elastic IP address remains allocated to your account until you explicitly release it\. We impose a small hourly charge for Elastic IP addresses that are not associated with a running instance\.
+ When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that previously had a public IPv4 address, the public DNS host name of the instance changes to match the Elastic IP address\.
+ We resolve a public DNS host name to the public IPv4 address or the Elastic IP address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance\.
+ When you allocate an Elastic IP address from an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account, it does not count toward your Elastic IP address limits\. For more information, see [Elastic IP address limit](#using-instance-addressing-limit)\.
+ When you allocate the Elastic IP addresses, you can associate the Elastic IP addresses with a network border group\. This is the location from which we advertise the CIDR block\. Setting the network border group limits the CIDR block to this group\. If you do not specify the network border group, we set the border group containing all of the Availability Zones in the Region \(for example, `us-west-2`\)\.
+ An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific network border group only\.

### Transfer Elastic IP addresses<a name="transfer-EIPs-intro-ec2"></a>

This section describes how to transfer Elastic IP addresses from one AWS account to another\. Transferring Elastic IP addresses can be helpful in the following situations:
+ **Organizational restructuring** – Use Elastic IP address transfers to quickly move workloads from one AWS account to another\. You don't have to wait for new Elastic IP addresses to be allowlisted in your security groups and NACLs\.
+ **Centralized security administration** – Use a centralized AWS security account to track and transfer Elastic IP addresses that have been vetted for security compliance\.
+ **Disaster recovery** – Use Elastic IP address transfers to quickly remap IPs for public\-facing internet workloads during emergency events\.

There is no charge for transferring Elastic IP addresses\.

**Topics**
+ [Enable Elastic IP address transfer](#using-instance-addressing-eips-transfer-enable-ec2)
+ [Disable Elastic IP address transfer](#using-instance-addressing-eips-transfer-disable-ec2)
+ [Accept a transferred Elastic IP address](#using-instance-addressing-eips-transfer-accept-ec2)

#### Enable Elastic IP address transfer<a name="using-instance-addressing-eips-transfer-enable-ec2"></a>

This section describes how to accept a transferred Elastic IP address\. Note the following limitations related to enabling Elastic IP addresses for transfer:
+ You can transfer Elastic IP addresses from any AWS account \(source account\) to any other AWS account in the same AWS Region \(transfer account\)\.
+ When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two\-step handshake between the AWS accounts\. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer accounts have seven hours to accept the Elastic IP address transfer, or the Elastic IP address is returned to its original owner\.
+ AWS does not notify transfer accounts about pending Elastic IP address transfer requests\. The owner of the source account must notify the owner of the transfer account that there is an Elastic IP address transfer request that they must accept\.
+ Any tags that are associated with an Elastic IP address being transferred are reset when the transfer is complete\.
+ You cannot transfer Elastic IP addresses allocated from public IPv4 address pools that you bring to your AWS account – commonly referred to as Bring Your Own IP \(BYOIP\) address pools\.
+ If you have enabled and configured AWS Outposts, you might have allocated Elastic IP addresses from a customer\-owned IP address pool \(CoIP\)\. You cannot transfer Elastic IP addresses allocated from a CoIP\. However, you can use AWS RAM to share a CoIP with another account\. For more information, see [Customer\-owned IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/routing.html#ip-addressing) in the *AWS Outposts User Guide*\.
+ You can use Amazon VPC IPAM to track the transfer of Elastic IP addresses to accounts in an organization from AWS Organizations\. For more information, see [View IP address history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/view-history-cidr-ipam.html)\. If an Elastic IP address is transferred to an AWS account outside of the organization, the IPAM audit history of the Elastic IP address is lost\.

These steps must be completed by the source account\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To enable Elastic IP address transfer**

1. Ensure that you're using the source AWS account\.

#### Accept a transferred Elastic IP address<a name="using-instance-addressing-eips-transfer-accept-ec2"></a>

This section describes how to accept a transferred Elastic IP address\.

When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two\-step handshake between AWS accounts: the source account \(either a standard AWS account or an AWS Organizations account\) and the transfer accounts\. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer accounts have seven hours to accept the Elastic IP address transfer, or the Elastic IP address will return to its original owner\. 

When accepting transfers, note the following exceptions that might occur and how to resolve them:
+ **AddressLimitExceeded**: If your transfer account has exceeded the Elastic IP address quota, the source account can enable Elastic IP address transfer, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer\. By default, all AWS accounts are limited to 5 Elastic IP addresses per Region\. See [Elastic IP address limit](#using-instance-addressing-limit) for instructions on increasing the limit\.
+ **InvalidTransfer\.AddressCustomPtrSet**: If you or someone in your organization has configured the Elastic IP address that you are attempting to transfer to use reverse DNS lookup, the source account can enable transfer for the Elastic IP address, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer\. To resolve this issue, the source account must remove the DNS record for the Elastic IP address\. For more information, see [Use reverse DNS for email applications](#Using_Elastic_Addressing_Reverse_DNS)\.
+ **InvalidTransfer\.AddressAssociated**: If an Elastic IP address is associated with an ENI or EC2 instance, the source account can enable transfer for the Elastic IP address, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer\. To resolve this issue, the source account must disassociate the Elastic IP address\. For more information, see [Disassociate an Elastic IP address](#using-instance-addressing-eips-associating-different)\.

For any other exceptions, [contact AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/)\.

These steps must be completed by the transfer account\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To accept an Elastic IP address transfer**

1. Ensure that you're using the transfer account\.

### Release an Elastic IP address<a name="using-instance-addressing-eips-releasing"></a>

If you no longer need an Elastic IP address, we recommend that you release it using one of the following methods\. The address to release must not be currently associated with an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance, NAT gateway, or Network Load Balancer\.

**Note**  
If you contacted AWS support to set up reverse DNS for an Elastic IP \(EIP\) address, you can remove the reverse DNS, but you can’t release the Elastic IP address because it’s been locked by AWS support\. To unlock the Elastic IP address, contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\. Once the Elastic IP address is unlocked, you can release the Elastic IP address\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To release an Elastic IP address**

------

### Recover an Elastic IP address<a name="using-eip-recovering"></a>

If you have released your Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it\. The following rules apply:
+ You cannot recover an Elastic IP address if it has been allocated to another AWS account, or if it will result in your exceeding your Elastic IP address limit\.
+ You cannot recover tags associated with an Elastic IP address\.
+ You can recover an Elastic IP address using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool only\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To recover an Elastic IP address**  
Use the [allocate\-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.html) AWS CLI command and specify the IP address using the `--address` parameter as follows\.

```

------

### Use reverse DNS for email applications<a name="Using_Elastic_Addressing_Reverse_DNS"></a>

If you intend to send email to third parties from an instance, we recommend that you provision one or more Elastic IP addresses and assign static reverse DNS records to the Elastic IP addresses that you use to send email\. This can help you avoid having your email flagged as spam by some anti\-spam organizations\. AWS works with ISPs and internet anti\-spam organizations to reduce the chance that your email sent from these addresses will be flagged as spam\.

**Considerations**
+ Before you create a reverse DNS record, you must set a corresponding forward DNS record \(record type A\) that points to your Elastic IP address\.
+ If a reverse DNS record is associated with an Elastic IP address, the Elastic IP address is locked to your account and cannot be released from your account until the record is removed\.
+ 

**AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region**  
You can't create a reverse DNS record using the console or AWS CLI\. AWS must assign the static reverse DNS records for you\. Open [Request to remove reverse DNS and email sending limitations](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/contacts?#/rdns-limits) and provide us with your Elastic IP addresses and reverse DNS records\.

#### Create a reverse DNS record<a name="eip-create-rdns-record"></a>

## Elastic IP address limit<a name="using-instance-addressing-limit"></a>

By default, all AWS accounts are limited to five \(5\) Elastic IP addresses per Region, because public \(IPv4\) internet addresses are a scarce public resource\. We strongly encourage you to use an Elastic IP address primarily for the ability to remap the address to another instance in the case of instance failure, and to use [DNS hostnames](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-hostnames) for all other inter\-node communication\.

**To verify how many Elastic IP addresses are in use**  
Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and choose **Elastic IPs** from the navigation pane\.

**To verify your current account limit for Elastic IP addresses**  
You can verify your limit in either the Amazon EC2 console or the Service Quotas console\. Do one of the following:
+ Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

  Choose **Limits** from the navigation pane, and then enter **IP** in the search field\. The limit is **EC2\-VPC Elastic IPs**\. If you have access to EC2\-Classic, there is an additional limit, **EC2\-Classic Elastic IPs**\.
+ Open the Service Quotas console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\.

  On the Dashboard, choose **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)**\. If Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) is not listed on the Dashboard, choose **AWS services**, enter **EC2** in the search field, and then choose **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)**\.

  On the Amazon EC2 service quotas page, enter **IP** in the search field\. The limit is **EC2\-VPC Elastic IPs**\. If you have access to EC2\-Classic, there is an additional limit, **EC2\-Classic Elastic IPs**\. For more information, choose the limit\.

If you think your architecture warrants additional Elastic IP addresses, you can request a quota increase directly from the Service Quotas console\.
