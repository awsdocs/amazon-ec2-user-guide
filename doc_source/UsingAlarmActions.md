# Create alarms that stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an instance<a name="UsingAlarmActions"></a>

Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your instances\. You can use the stop or terminate actions to help you save money when you no longer need an instance to be running\. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs\.

The `AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents` service\-linked role enables AWS to perform alarm actions on your behalf\. The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API, CloudWatch creates the service\-linked role for you\.

There are a number of scenarios in which you might want to automatically stop or terminate your instance\. For example, you might have instances dedicated to batch payroll processing jobs or scientific computing tasks that run for a period of time and then complete their work\. Rather than letting those instances sit idle \(and accrue charges\), you can stop or terminate them, which can help you to save money\. The main difference between using the stop and the terminate alarm actions is that you can easily start a stopped instance if you need to run it again later, and you can keep the same instance ID and root volume\. However, you cannot start a terminated instance\. Instead, you must launch a new instance\.

You can add the stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions to any alarm that is set on an Amazon EC2 per\-instance metric, including basic and detailed monitoring metrics provided by Amazon CloudWatch \(in the `AWS/EC2` namespace\), as well as any custom metrics that include the `InstanceId` dimension, as long as its value refers to a valid running Amazon EC2 instance\.

**Console support**  
You can create alarms using the Amazon EC2 console or the CloudWatch console\. The procedures in this documentation use the Amazon EC2 console\. For procedures that use the CloudWatch console, see [Create alarms that stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/UsingAlarmActions.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Permissions**  
If you are an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, you must have the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` to create or modify an alarm that performs EC2 alarm actions\.

## Add stop actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms<a name="AddingStopActions"></a>

You can create an alarm that stops an Amazon EC2 instance when a certain threshold has been met\. For example, you may run development or test instances and occasionally forget to shut them off\. You can create an alarm that is triggered when the average CPU utilization percentage has been lower than 10 percent for 24 hours, signaling that it is idle and no longer in use\. You can adjust the threshold, duration, and period to suit your needs, plus you can add an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) notification so that you receive an email when the alarm is triggered\.

Instances that use an Amazon EBS volume as the root device can be stopped or terminated, whereas instances that use the instance store as the root device can only be terminated\.

## Add terminate actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms<a name="AddingTerminateActions"></a>

You can create an alarm that terminates an EC2 instance automatically when a certain threshold has been met \(as long as termination protection is not enabled for the instance\)\. For example, you might want to terminate an instance when it has completed its work, and you donâ€™t need the instance again\. If you might want to use the instance later, you should stop the instance instead of terminating it\. For information on enabling and disabling termination protection for an instance, see [Enable termination protection](terminating-instances.md#Using_ChangingDisableAPITermination)\.

## Add reboot actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms<a name="AddingRebootActions"></a>

You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically reboots the instance\. The reboot alarm action is recommended for Instance Health Check failures \(as opposed to the recover alarm action, which is suited for System Health Check failures\)\. An instance reboot is equivalent to an operating system reboot\. In most cases, it takes only a few minutes to reboot your instance\. When you reboot an instance, it remains on the same physical host, so your instance keeps its public DNS name, private IP address, and any data on its instance store volumes\.

Rebooting an instance doesn't start a new instance billing period \(with a minimum one\-minute charge\), unlike stopping and restarting your instance\. For more information, see [Reboot your instance](ec2-instance-reboot.md)\.

**Important**  
To avoid a race condition between the reboot and recover actions, avoid setting the same number of evaluation periods for a reboot alarm and a recover alarm\. We recommend that you set reboot alarms to three evaluation periods of one minute each\. For more information, see [Evaluating an alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

## Add recover actions to Amazon CloudWatch alarms<a name="AddingRecoverActions"></a>

You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance\. If the instance becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair, you can automatically recover the instance\. Terminated instances cannot be recovered\. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata\.

CloudWatch prevents you from adding a recovery action to an alarm that is on an instance which does not support recovery actions\.

When the `StatusCheckFailed_System` alarm is triggered, and the recover action is initiated, you are notified by the Amazon SNS topic that you chose when you created the alarm and associated the recover action\. During instance recovery, the instance is migrated during an instance reboot, and any data that is in\-memory is lost\. When the process is complete, information is published to the SNS topic you've configured for the alarm\. Anyone who is subscribed to this SNS topic receives an email notification that includes the status of the recovery attempt and any further instructions\. You notice an instance reboot on the recovered instance\.

**Note**  
The recover action can be used only with `StatusCheckFailed_System`, not with `StatusCheckFailed_Instance`\.

The following problems can cause system status checks to fail:
+ Loss of network connectivity
+ Loss of system power
+ Software issues on the physical host
+ Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability

The recover action is supported only on instances that meet certain characteristics\. For more information, see [Recover your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html)\.

If your instance has a public IP address, it retains the public IP address after recovery\.

**Important**  
To avoid a race condition between the reboot and recover actions, avoid setting the same number of evaluation periods for a reboot alarm and a recover alarm\. We recommend that you set recover alarms to two evaluation periods of one minute each\.
