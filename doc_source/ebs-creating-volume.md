# Create an Amazon EBS volume<a name="ebs-creating-volume"></a>

You can create an Amazon EBS volume and then attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone\. If you create an encrypted EBS volume, you can only attach it to supported instance types\. For more information, see [Supported instance types](EBSEncryption.md#EBSEncryption_supported_instances)\.

If you are creating a volume for a high\-performance storage scenario, you should make sure to use a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume \(`io1` or `io2`\) and attach it to an instance with enough bandwidth to support your application, such as an EBS\-optimized instance\. The same advice holds for Throughput Optimized HDD \(`st1`\) and Cold HDD \(`sc1`\) volumes\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“optimized instances](ebs-optimized.md)\.

Empty EBS volumes receive their maximum performance the moment that they are available and do not require initialization \(formerly known as pre\-warming\)\. However, storage blocks on volumes that were created from snapshots must be initialized \(pulled down from Amazon S3 and written to the volume\) before you can access the block\. This preliminary action takes time and can cause a significant increase in the latency of an I/O operation the first time each block is accessed\. Volume performance is achieved after all blocks have been downloaded and written to the volume\. For most applications, amortizing this cost over the lifetime of the volume is acceptable\. To avoid this initial performance hit in a production environment, you can force immediate initialization of the entire volume or enable fast snapshot restore\. For more information, see [Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](ebs-initialize.md)\.

**Important**  
If you create an `io2` volume with a size greater than `16` TiB or with IOPS greater than `64,000` in a Region where EBS Block Express is supported, the volume automatically runs on Block Express\. `io2` Block Express volumes can be attached to supported instances only\. For more information, see [`io2` Block Express volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html#io2-block-express)\.

**Methods of creating a volume**
+ Create and attach EBS volumes when you launch instances by specifying a block device mapping\. For more information, see [Launch an instance using the old launch instance wizard](launching-instance.md) and [Block device mappings](block-device-mapping-concepts.md)\.
+ Create an empty EBS volume and attach it to a running instance\. For more information, see [Create an empty volume](#ebs-create-empty-volume) below\.
+ Create an EBS volume from a previously created snapshot and attach it to a running instance\. For more information, see [Create a volume from a snapshot](#ebs-create-volume-from-snapshot) below\.

## Create a volume from a snapshot<a name="ebs-create-volume-from-snapshot"></a>

Volumes created from snapshots load lazily in the background\. This means that there is no need to wait for all of the data to transfer from Amazon S3 to your EBS volume before the instance can start accessing an attached volume and all its data\. If your instance accesses data that hasn't yet been loaded, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then continues loading the rest of the volume data in the background\. Volume performance is achieved after all blocks are downloaded and written to the volume\. To avoid the initial performance hit in a production environment, see [Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](ebs-initialize.md)\.

New EBS volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted\. You can also encrypt a volume on\-the\-fly while restoring it from an unencrypted snapshot\. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instance types that support EBS encryption\. For more information, see [Supported instance types](EBSEncryption.md#EBSEncryption_supported_instances)\.
