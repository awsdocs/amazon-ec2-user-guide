# Troubleshoot instances with failed status checks<a name="TroubleshootingInstances"></a>

The following information can help you troubleshoot issues if your instance fails a status check\. First determine whether your applications are exhibiting any problems\. If you verify that the instance is not running your applications as expected, review the status check information and the system logs\.

For examples of problems that can cause status checks to fail, see [Status checks for your instances](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md)\.

## Review status check information<a name="InitialSteps"></a>

**To investigate impaired instances using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and then select your instance\.

1. In the details pane, choose **Status Checks** to see the individual results for all **System Status Checks** and **Instance Status Checks**\.

If a system status check has failed, you can try one of the following options:
+ Create an instance recovery alarm\. For more information, see [Create alarms that stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an instance](UsingAlarmActions.md)\.
+ If you changed the instance type to an instance built on the [Nitro System](instance-types.md#ec2-nitro-instances), status checks fail if you migrated from an instance that does not have the required ENA and NVMe drivers\. For more information, see [Compatibility for changing the instance type](resize-limitations.md)\.
+ For an instance using an Amazon EBS\-backed AMI, stop and restart the instance\.
+ For an instance using an instance\-store backed AMI, terminate the instance and launch a replacement\.
+ Wait for Amazon EC2 to resolve the issue\.
+ Post your issue to the [Amazon EC2 forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=30)\.
+ If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service automatically launches a replacement instance\. For more information, see [Health Checks for Auto Scaling Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/healthcheck.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*\.
+ Retrieve the system log and look for errors\.

## Retrieve the system logs<a name="troubleshooting-retrieve-system-logs"></a>

If an instance status check fails, you can reboot the instance and retrieve the system logs\. The logs may reveal an error that can help you troubleshoot the issue\. Rebooting clears unnecessary information from the logs\.

**To reboot an instance and retrieve the system log**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and select your instance\.

1. Choose **Instance state**, **Reboot instance**\. It might take a few minutes for your instance to reboot\.

1. Verify that the problem still exists; in some cases, rebooting may resolve the problem\.

1. When the instance is in the `running` state, choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**, **Get system log**\.

1. Review the log that appears on the screen, and use the list of known system log error statements below to troubleshoot your issue\.

1. If your experience differs from our check results, or if you are having an issue with your instance that our checks did not detect, choose **Submit feedback** on the **Status Checks** tab to help us improve our detection tests\.

1. If your issue is not resolved, you can post your issue to the [Amazon EC2 forum](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=30)\.

## Troubleshoot system log errors for Linux\-based instances<a name="system-log-errors-linux"></a>

### Potential causes<a name="DeviceBlock-potential-cause"></a>


| Instance type  | Potential cause | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Amazon EBS\-backed  |  A failed Amazon EBS volume   | 
|  Instance store\-backed  |  A failed physical drive   | 

### Suggested actions<a name="DeviceBlock-suggested-actions"></a>


| For this instance type  | Do this | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Amazon EBS\-backed  |  Use the following procedure: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html)  | 
|  Instance store\-backed  |   Terminate the instance and launch a new instance\.  Data cannot be recovered\. Recover from backups\.   It's a good practice to use either Amazon S3 or Amazon EBS for backups\. Instance store volumes are directly tied to single host and single disk failures\.   | 

## I/O ERROR: neither local nor remote disk \(Broken distributed block device\)<a name="DeviceDistributed"></a>

An input/output error on the device is indicated by a system log entry similar to the following example:

```
...
block drbd1: Local IO failed in request_timer_fn. Detaching...

Aborting journal on device drbd1-8.

block drbd1: IO ERROR: neither local nor remote disk

Buffer I/O error on device drbd1, logical block 557056

lost page write due to I/O error on drbd1

```

### Potential causes<a name="DeviceDistributed-potential-cause"></a>


| Instance type  | Potential cause | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Amazon EBS\-backed  |  A failed Amazon EBS volume   | 
|  Instance store\-backed  |  A failed physical drive   | 

### Suggested action<a name="DeviceDistributed-suggested-actions"></a>

Terminate the instance and launch a new instance\. 

For an Amazon EBS\-backed instance you can recover data from a recent snapshot by creating an image from it\. Any data added after the snapshot cannot be recovered\.

## request\_module: runaway loop modprobe \(Looping legacy kernel modprobe on older Linux versions\)<a name="KernelLoop"></a>

This condition is indicated by a system log similar to the one shown below\. Using an unstable or old Linux kernel \(for example, 2\.6\.16\-xenU\) can cause an interminable loop condition at startup\.
