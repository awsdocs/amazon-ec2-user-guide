# Identify EC2 Linux instances<a name="identify_ec2_instances"></a>

You might need to determine whether your application is running on an EC2 instance\.

For information about identifying Windows instances, see [Identify EC2 Windows instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/identify_ec2_instances.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\.

## Inspect the instance identity document<a name="inspect-document"></a>

For a definitive and cryptographically verified method of identifying an EC2 instance, check the instance identity document, including its signature\. These documents are available on every EC2 instance at the local, non\-routable address `http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/`\. For more information, see [Instance identity documents](instance-identity-documents.md)\.

## Inspect the system UUID<a name="inspect-uuid"></a>

You can get the system UUID and look for the presence of the characters "ec2" or "EC2" in the beginning octet of the UUID\. This method to determine whether a system is an EC2 instance is quick but potentially inaccurate because there is a small chance that a system that is not an EC2 instance could have a UUID that starts with these characters\. Furthermore, for EC2 instances that are not using Amazon Linux 2, the distribution's implementation of SMBIOS might represent the UUID in little\-endian format, therefore the "EC2" characters do not appear at the beginning of the UUID\.

**Example : Get the UUID from DMI \(HVM AMIs only\)**  
Use the following command to get the UUID using the Desktop Management Interface \(DMI\):  

```
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dmidecode --string system-uuid
```
In the following example output, the UUID starts with "EC2", which indicates that the system is probably an EC2 instance\.  

```
EC2E1916-9099-7CAF-FD21-012345ABCDEF
```
In the following example output, the UUID is represented in little\-endian format\.  

```
45E12AEC-DCD1-B213-94ED-012345ABCDEF
```
Alternatively, for instances built on the Nitro system, you can use the following command:  

```
[ec2-user ~]$ cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_asset_tag
```
If the output is an instance ID, as the following example output, the system is an EC2 instance:  

```
i-0af01c0123456789a
```

**Example : Get the UUID from the hypervisor \(PV AMIs only\)**  
Use the following command to get the UUID from the hypervisor:  

```
[ec2-user ~]$ cat /sys/hypervisor/uuid
```
In the following example output, the UUID starts with "ec2", which indicates that the system is probably an EC2 instance\.  

```
ec2e1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef
```

## Inspect the system virtual machine generation identifier<a name="vm-generation-id"></a>

A virtual machine generation identifier consists of a unique buffer of 128\-bit interpreted as cryptographic random integer identifier\. You can retrieve the virtual machine generation identifier to identify your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance\. The generation identifier is exposed within the guest operating system of the instance through an ACPI table entry\. The value will change if your machine is cloned, copied, or imported into AWS, such as with [VM Import/Export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/what-is-vmimport.html)\.

**Example : Retrieve the virtual machine generation identifier from Linux**  
You can use the following commands retrieve the virtual machine generation identifier from your instances running Linux:  

1. Update your existing software packages, as necessary, using the following command:

   ```
   sudo yum update
   ```

1. If necessary, source the busybox package with the following command:

   ```
   sudo curl https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/epel/next/8/Everything/x86_64/Packages/b/busybox-1.35.0-2.el8.next.x86_64.rpm --output busybox.rpm
   ```

1. If necessary, install the prerequisite packages using the following command:

   ```
   sudo yum install busybox.rpm iasl -y
   ```

1. Run the following `iasl` command to produce output from the ACPI table:

   ```
   sudo iasl -p ./SSDT2 -d /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/SSDT2
   ```

1. Run the following command to review the output of the `iasl` command:

   ```
   cat SSDT2.dsl
   ```

   The output should yield the address space required to retrieve the virtual machine generation identifier:
