# Deprecated: Collect metrics using the CloudWatch monitoring scripts<a name="monitoring-scripts-intro"></a>

**Important**  
The CloudWatch monitoring scripts are deprecated\. We provide information about the monitoring scripts for customers who have not yet migrated from the deprecated monitoring scripts to the CloudWatch agent\.  
We recommend that you use the CloudWatch agent to collect metrics and logs\. For more information, see [Collect metrics and logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on\-premises servers with the CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

The monitoring scripts demonstrate how to produce and consume custom metrics for Amazon CloudWatch\. These sample Perl scripts comprise a fully functional example that reports memory, swap, and disk space utilization metrics for a Linux instance\. 

Standard Amazon CloudWatch usage charges for custom metrics apply to your use of these scripts\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing) pricing page\.

Ensure that the scripts have permission to call the following actions by associating an IAM role with your instance:
+ `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`
+ `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
+ `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
+ `ec2:DescribeTags`

For more information, see [Work with IAM roles](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md#working-with-iam-roles)\.

## Install required packages<a name="mon-scripts-perl_prereq"></a>

With some versions of Linux, you must install additional Perl modules before you can use the monitoring scripts\.

## Install monitoring scripts<a name="mon-scripts-getstarted"></a>

The following steps show you how to download, uncompress, and configure the CloudWatch monitoring scripts on an EC2 Linux instance\.

**To download, install, and configure the monitoring scripts**

1. At a command prompt, move to a folder where you want to store the monitoring scripts and run the following command to download them:

   ```
   curl https://aws-cloudwatch.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip -O
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install the monitoring scripts you downloaded:

   ```
   unzip CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip && \
   rm CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip && \
   cd aws-scripts-mon
   ```

The package for the monitoring scripts contains the following files:
+ **CloudWatchClient\.pm** – Shared Perl module that simplifies calling Amazon CloudWatch from other scripts\.
+ **mon\-put\-instance\-data\.pl** – Collects system metrics on an Amazon EC2 instance \(memory, swap, disk space utilization\) and sends them to Amazon CloudWatch\.
+ **mon\-get\-instance\-stats\.pl** – Queries Amazon CloudWatch and displays the most recent utilization statistics for the EC2 instance on which this script is run\.
+ **awscreds\.template** – File template for AWS credentials that stores your access key ID and secret access key\.
+ **LICENSE\.txt** – Text file containing the Apache 2\.0 license\.
+ **NOTICE\.txt** – Copyright notice\.

## mon\-put\-instance\-data\.pl<a name="using_put_script"></a>

This script collects memory, swap, and disk space utilization data on the current system\. It then makes a remote call to Amazon CloudWatch to report the collected data as custom metrics\.


**Options**  

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|   `--mem-util `   |  Collects and sends the MemoryUtilization metrics in percentages\. This metric counts memory allocated by applications and the operating system as used, and also includes cache and buffer memory as used if you specify the `--mem-used-incl-cache-buff` option\.   | 
|   `--mem-used `   |   Collects and sends the MemoryUsed metrics, reported in megabytes\. This metric counts memory allocated by applications and the operating system as used, and also includes cache and buffer memory as used if you specify the `--mem-used-incl-cache-buff` option\.  | 
|   `--mem-used-incl-cache-buff `   |  If you include this option, memory currently used for cache and buffers is counted as "used" when the metrics are reported for `--mem-util`, `--mem-used`, and `--mem-avail`\.  | 
|   `--mem-avail `   |   Collects and sends the MemoryAvailable metrics, reported in megabytes\. This metric counts memory allocated by applications and the operating system as used, and also includes cache and buffer memory as used if you specify the `--mem-used-incl-cache-buff` option\.   | 
|   `--swap-util `   |   Collects and sends SwapUtilization metrics, reported in percentages\.   | 
|   `--swap-used `   |   Collects and sends SwapUsed metrics, reported in megabytes\.   | 
|   `--disk-path=PATH `   |   Selects the disk on which to report\.  PATH can specify a mount point or any file located on a mount point for the filesystem that needs to be reported\. For selecting multiple disks, specify a `--disk-path=PATH` for each one of them\.   To select a disk for the filesystems mounted on `/` and `/home`, use the following parameters:  `--disk-path=/ --disk-path=/home`  | 
|   `--disk-space-util`   |  Collects and sends the DiskSpaceUtilization metric for the selected disks\. The metric is reported in percentages\. Note that the disk utilization metrics calculated by this script differ from the values calculated by the df \-k \-l command\. If you find the values from df \-k \-l more useful, you can change the calculations in the script\.  | 
|   `--disk-space-used`   |  Collects and sends the DiskSpaceUsed metric for the selected disks\. The metric is reported by default in gigabytes\.   Due to reserved disk space in Linux operating systems, disk space used and disk space available might not accurately add up to the amount of total disk space\.   | 
|   `--disk-space-avail `   |  Collects and sends the DiskSpaceAvailable metric for the selected disks\. The metric is reported in gigabytes\.   Due to reserved disk space in the Linux operating systems, disk space used and disk space available might not accurately add up to the amount of total disk space\.   | 
|   `--memory-units=UNITS `   |  Specifies units in which to report memory usage\. If not specified, memory is reported in megabytes\. UNITS may be one of the following: bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes\.   | 
|   `--disk-space-units=UNITS `   |  Specifies units in which to report disk space usage\. If not specified, disk space is reported in gigabytes\. UNITS may be one of the following: bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes\.   | 
|   `--aws-credential- file=PATH `   |  Provides the location of the file containing AWS credentials\.  This parameter cannot be used with the `--aws-access-key-id` and \-`-aws-secret-key` parameters\.   | 
|   `--aws-access-key-id=VALUE `   |  Specifies the AWS access key ID to use to identify the caller\. Must be used together with the `--aws-secret-key` option\. Do not use this option with the `--aws-credential-file` parameter\.   | 
|   `--aws-secret-key=VALUE `   |  Specifies the AWS secret access key to use to sign the request to CloudWatch\. Must be used together with the `--aws-access-key-id` option\. Do not use this option with `--aws-credential-file` parameter\.  | 
|   `--aws-iam-role=VALUE`   |  Specifies the IAM role used to provide AWS credentials\. The value `=VALUE` is required\. If no credentials are specified, the default IAM role associated with the EC2 instance is applied\. Only one IAM role can be used\. If no IAM roles are found, or if more than one IAM role is found, the script will return an error\. Do not use this option with the `--aws-credential-file`, `--aws-access-key-id`, or `--aws-secret-key` parameters\.  | 
|   `--aggregated[=only]`   |  Adds aggregated metrics for instance type, AMI ID, and overall for the Region\. The value `=only` is optional; if specified, the script reports only aggregated metrics\.  | 
|   `--auto-scaling[=only]`   |  Adds aggregated metrics for the Auto Scaling group\. The value `=only` is optional; if specified, the script reports only Auto Scaling metrics\. The [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html) associated with the IAM user or role using the scripts need to have permissions to call the EC2 action [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeTags.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeTags.html)\.  | 
|   `--verify `   |  Performs a test run of the script that collects the metrics, prepares a complete HTTP request, but does not actually call CloudWatch to report the data\. This option also checks that credentials are provided\. When run in verbose mode, this option outputs the metrics that will be sent to CloudWatch\.   | 
|   `--from-cron `   |  Use this option when calling the script from cron\. When this option is used, all diagnostic output is suppressed, but error messages are sent to the local system log of the user\.   | 
|   `--verbose `   |  Displays detailed information about what the script is doing\.   | 
|   `--help `   |  Displays usage information\.   | 
|   `--version `   |  Displays the version number of the script\.   | 

**Examples**  
The following examples assume that you provided an IAM role or `awscreds.conf` file\. Otherwise, you must provide credentials using the `--aws-access-key-id` and `--aws-secret-key` parameters for these commands\.

The following example performs a simple test run without posting data to CloudWatch\.

```
./mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-util --verify --verbose
```

The following example collects all available memory metrics and sends them to CloudWatch, counting cache and buffer memory as used

```
./mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-used-incl-cache-buff --mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail
```

The following example collects aggregated metrics for an Auto Scaling group and sends them to Amazon CloudWatch without reporting individual instance metrics\.

```
./mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail --auto-scaling=only
```

The following example collects aggregated metrics for instance type, AMI ID and region, and sends them to Amazon CloudWatch without reporting individual instance metrics

```
./mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail --aggregated=only
```

To set a cron schedule for metrics reported to CloudWatch, start editing the crontab using the crontab \-e command\. Add the following command to report memory and disk space utilization to CloudWatch every five minutes:

```
1. */5 * * * * ~/aws-scripts-mon/mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-used-incl-cache-buff --mem-util --disk-space-util --disk-path=/ --from-cron
```

If the script encounters an error, it writes the error message in the system log\.

## mon\-get\-instance\-stats\.pl<a name="using_get_script_powershell"></a>

This script queries CloudWatch for statistics on memory, swap, and disk space metrics within the time interval provided using the number of most recent hours\. This data is provided for the Amazon EC2 instance on which this script is run\.


**Options**  

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|   `--recent-hours=N`   |  Specifies the number of recent hours to report on, as represented by `N` where N is an integer\.   | 
|   `--aws-credential-file=PATH `   |  Provides the location of the file containing AWS credentials\.   | 
|   `--aws-access-key-id=VALUE `   |  Specifies the AWS access key ID to use to identify the caller\. Must be used together with the `--aws-secret-key` option\. Do not use this option with the `--aws-credential-file` option\.   | 
|   `--aws-secret-key=VALUE `   |  Specifies the AWS secret access key to use to sign the request to CloudWatch\. Must be used together with the `--aws-access-key-id` option\. Do not use this option with `--aws-credential-file` option\.   | 
|   `--aws-iam-role=VALUE`   |  Specifies the IAM role used to provide AWS credentials\. The value `=VALUE` is required\. If no credentials are specified, the default IAM role associated with the EC2 instance is applied\. Only one IAM role can be used\. If no IAM roles are found, or if more than one IAM role is found, the script will return an error\. Do not use this option with the `--aws-credential-file`, `--aws-access-key-id`, or `--aws-secret-key` parameters\.  | 
|   `--verify `   |  Performs a test run of the script\. This option also checks that credentials are provided\.  | 
|   `--verbose `   |  Displays detailed information about what the script is doing\.   | 
|   `--help `   |  Displays usage information\.   | 
|   `--version `   |  Displays the version number of the script\.   | 

**Example**  
To get utilization statistics for the last 12 hours, run the following command:

```
./mon-get-instance-stats.pl --recent-hours=12
```

The following is an example response:

```
Instance metric statistics for the last 12 hours.

CPU Utilization
    Average: 1.06%, Minimum: 0.00%, Maximum: 15.22%

Memory Utilization
    Average: 6.84%, Minimum: 6.82%, Maximum: 6.89%

Swap Utilization
    Average: N/A, Minimum: N/A, Maximum: N/A

Disk Space Utilization on /dev/xvda1 mounted as /
    Average: 9.69%, Minimum: 9.69%, Maximum: 9.69%
```

## View your custom metrics in the console<a name="script_viewmetrics"></a>

After you successfully run the `mon-put-instance-data.pl` script, you can view your custom metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch console\.

**To view custom metrics**

1. Run `mon-put-instance-data.pl` as described previously\.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose **View Metrics**\.

1. For **Viewing**, your custom metrics posted by the script are displayed with the prefix `System/Linux`\.

## Troubleshoot<a name="mon-script-troubleshooting"></a>

The **CloudWatchClient\.pm** module caches instance metadata locally\. If you create an AMI from an instance where you have run the monitoring scripts, any instances launched from the AMI within the cache TTL \(default: six hours, 24 hours for Auto Scaling groups\) emit metrics using the instance ID of the original instance\. After the cache TTL time period passes, the script retrieves fresh data and the monitoring scripts use the instance ID of the current instance\. To immediately correct this, remove the cached data using the following command:

```
rm /var/tmp/aws-mon/instance-id
```
