# Amazon Elastic Inference<a name="elastic-inference"></a>

Amazon Elastic Inference \(EI\) is a resource you can attach to your Amazon EC2 CPU instances to accelerate your deep learning \(DL\) inference workloads\. Amazon EI accelerators come in multiple sizes and are a cost\-effective method to build intelligent capabilities into applications running on Amazon EC2 instances\. 

Amazon EI distributes model operations defined by TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, and the Open Neural Network Exchange \(ONNX\) format through MXNet between low\-cost, DL inference accelerators and the CPU of the instance\. 

For more information about Amazon Elastic Inference, see the [Amazon EI Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastic-inference/latest/developerguide/what-is-ei.html)\.
